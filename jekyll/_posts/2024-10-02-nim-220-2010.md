title: "Nim versions 2.2.0 and 2.0.10 released"
author: The Nim Team
---

The Nim Team is happy to announce two releases:
- version 2.2.0, our new stable release
- version 2.0.10, a patch release for Nim 2.0

Nim v2.2.0 is a continuation of our efforts to improve Nim 2: it contains almost 1000 new commits, bringing improvements to the ORC memory management and to the language and the compiler overall.

Nim v2.0.10 is a patch release aimed at our enterprise users who cannot immediately switch to Nim 2.2, containing 80 commits with bugfixes.




## Nim 2.2.0


### Release highlights

Many long-standing compiler bugs with generics, `typedesc` and `static` types have been fixed in this release, effectively making these features stable.
In particular, arbitrary expressions for types and values in generic types are now largely functional when they only worked in specific cases before.
The release has a focus on bugfixes in general, with many other issues fixed across the board.

This release continues with the improvements regarding C++ interop:
- `noInit` can be used in types and fields to disable member initializers in the C++ backend.
- C++ [custom constructors initializers](https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual_experimental.html#constructor-pragma).
- `member` can be used to attach a procedure to a C++ type.
- C++ `constructor` now reuses `result` instead creating `this`.

JS backend now supports lambda lifting for closures and closure iterators.

Methods now support implementations based on a VTable by using `--experimental:vtables`.
Methods are then confined to the same module where their type has been defined.

Tuple unpacking got a bit more powerful:
- Tuple unpacking assignment now supports using underscores to discard values.
  ```nim
  var a, c: int
  (a, _, c) = (1, 2, 3)
  ```
- Tuple unpacking variable declarations now support type annotations, but
  only for the entire tuple.
  ```nim
  let (a, b): (int, int) = (1, 2)
  let (a, (b, c)): (byte, (float, cstring)) = (1, (2, "abc"))
  ```

An experimental switch `--experimental:openSym` has been added to deal with issues with symbol captures inside generic routines & templates.
For macro authors, this adds a new node kind `nnkOpenSym` that may need to be handled differently (similar to `nnkOpenSymChoice`). See the full changelog for details. 

Nim 2.2.0 ships with Nimble 0.16.1, which brings a SAT solver as an opt-in option.
