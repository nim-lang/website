# Nim fusion

Fusion contains Nim modules that are ment to be treated as an extension to
stdlib. Currently, the following modules are present:

- `fusion/smartptrs` - C++-like unique/shared pointers
- `fusion/btreetables` - sorted associative containers
- `fusion/matching` - pattern matching implementation using nim macros - main focus of this article
- `fusion/htmlparser` - HTML parser
- `fusion/astdsl` - karax-style DSL for constructing an AST
- `fusion/filepermissions` - convenience functions for working with file permissions.

Documentation index can be found [here](https://nim-lang.github.io/fusion/theindex.html), project repository: [link](https://github.com/nim-lang/fusion).

To install fusion simply run ``nimble install fusion``. To try out without installing use [nim playground](https://play.nim-lang.org/#ix=2Qzc)


```nim
import fusion/matching

{.experimental: "caseStmtMacros".}

case [(1, 3), (3, 4)]:
  of [(1, @a), _]:
    echo a

  else:
    echo "Match failed"
```

# Pattern matching introduction

New pattern matcing library introduces support for two very useful concepts: **pattern matching** and **object destructuring**.

Pattern matching is a mechanism that allows you to check particular object against the pattern - you could think of it mainly as a way to reduce boilerplate code when comparing objects for equality, checking if value is within range, particular key is present in table and so on.

```nim
import std/json, fusion/matching

{.experimental: "caseStmtMacros".}

# Json is very simple data format, but illustrates a lot of useful features
# of pattern matching
case parseJson("""{ "key" : "value" }"""):
  # No longer necessary to check if key is present - it is done
  # automatically
  of { "key" : JInt() }:
    discard

  # Extracting values from nested data structures also becomes much easier.
  of { "key" : (getStr: @val) }:
    echo val
    assert val is string
```

    value

Second - object destructuring - allows you to extract values from particular fields in object. It is very common in dynamic programming languages such as python. Simplest form of destructuring is already supported by nim - tuple unpacking:

```nim
let (val1, val2) = ("some", 12)
```

And with pattern matching you can now unpack sequences, tables and custom objects.

```nim
[(@first, @second), all @trail] := [(12, 3), (33, 4), (12, 33)]
echo first, ", ", second, ", ", trail
```

```
    12, 3, @[(33, 4), (12, 33)]
```


# Using pattern matching in regular code

Main purpose of pattern matching is simplification of conditions, and consecutive checks. It is especially useful when paired with [object variants](https://nim-lang.org/docs/tut2.html#object-oriented-programming-object-variants), but can also be used to do a lot of other things, such as [key-value pairs matching](https://nim-lang.github.io/fusion/src/fusion/matching.html#matching-different-things-kvminuspairs-matching), extensive support for [sequence matching](https://nim-lang.github.io/fusion/src/fusion/matching.html#matching-different-things-sequence-matching). Special syntactic sugar is provided for very common use cases, such as `Option[T]` checking (similar to `if let` in Rust):

```nim
import std/options

if Some(@val) ?= some("hello"):
  echo val, ". Is string? ", val is string
```

    hello. Is string? true

And matching tree structures of case objects (such as AST). For enum conforming to [nep1 style guide](https://nim-lang.org/docs/nep1.html#introduction-naming-conventions) naming conventions, you can omit prefix entirely leading to code that looks roughtly like this:

```nim
case <some AST node>:
  # Node kind is `nnkIdent`, but it is possible to omit `nnk`
  of Ident(strVal: @name):
    echo "Found ident: ", name

  # Extracting subnodes from infix expression.
  of InfixExpr[Ident(strVal: "+"), @lhs, @rhs]:
    ...

  # Matching if statements with *exactly* two branches. No need to worry
  # about indexing exceptions - `len` is checked accordingly during pattern
  # matching.
  of IfStmt[ElifBranch[@cond1, _], ElifBranch[@cond2, _]]:
    ...
```


# Using pattern matching for writing macros

Nim macros are one of the most powerful and parts of the language, but they might seem a little intimidating for newcomers, especially when it comes to implementing macro for solving particular problem at hand.

This article gives an example on how one can easily create relatively complex macro using new pattern matching library.

We will be creating macro for dataflow programming, with support for some operatings in the `std/sequtils` module (map/filter/each). The macro won't be covering all possible combinations and use cases as it would make implementation significantly more complicated.


## First step - design DSL

When writing macro, it is very useful to just write DSL code (as if you already had macro) and what you expect it to generate. Decide out *what you want to do* and *how it should look*. In our case input could looks roughly like this:

```nim
flow lines("/etc/passwd"):
  map[_, seq[string]]:
    it.split(":")
  keepIf:
    it.len > 1 and
    it.matches [_.startsWith("systemd"), .._]
  each:
    echo it
```

And should generate loop that looks like this:

```nim
var res = seq[ResType]
for it0 in lines("/etc/passwd"):
  let it1 = it0.split(":")
  if it1.len > 1 and it1.matches [_.startsWith("systemd"), .._]:
    echo it1
```


## Analyze DSL parse tree

Now the question is - how to transform first into second? We will start by first looking at the output for `dumpTree` on `flow` macro:

```nim
dumpTree:
  flow lines("/etc/passwd"):
    map[_, seq[string]]:
      it.split(":")
```

```nim
 1  StmtList
 2    Command
 3      Ident "flow"
 4      Call
 5        Ident "lines"
 6        StrLit "/etc/passwd"
 7      StmtList
 8        Call
 9          BracketExpr
10            Ident "map"
11            Ident "_"
12            BracketExpr
13              Ident "seq"
14              Ident "string"
15          StmtList
16            Call
17              DotExpr
18                Ident "it"
19                Ident "split"
20              StrLit ":"
```

This load of text might seem a little confusing at first, but in the end it can be taken apart quite easily (and that is exactly what we will be doing). First, on line 3 we see the `flow` identifier (`Ident "flow"`) - this is a start of our macro. Then, on the next line is a `lines("/etc/passwd")` argument.


## Intermediate representation

I usually try to introduce some kind of intermediate representation for DSL in order to make things more organized and decouple parsing stage from code generation. This might make implementation a little longer, but more extensible and robust. You can, without a doubt, just go directly to code generation, but for more complex DSL I would still recommend using some kind of IR.

In this particular case DSL structure for `flow` macro can be described as:

```nim
type
  FlowStageKind = enum
    fskMap # Stage for element conversion
    fskFilter # Filter elements
    fskEach # Execute action without returning value

  FlowStage = object
    outputType: Option[NimNode] # Assert result type
    kind: FlowStageKind # Type of the stage
    body: NimNode # Stage body
```

it directly maps on the input DSL. `map:` should create `fskMap` stage, `filter` creates `fskFilter` and so on. Optionally you can specify output type like this `map [ExpectedOutput]`.


## Pattern matching

Now, after we have good understanding of what exactly we want to do - the question is 'how?'. That's where [`fusion/matching`](https://nim-lang.github.io/fusion/src/fusion/matching.html) comes particularly handy - we already identifier all patterns, and now it is only matter of writing this down in code.

Without pattern matching you'd be left with long series of repeating `[0][0][0]` and `if kind == nnkBracketExpr` in order to retrieve parts from DSL and validate input.

Before we proceed to writing paterns for whole DSL it is important to consider three possible cases of writing a stage. First once is very simple - no type specified, only stage identifier.

```nim
dumpTree:
  map:
    body
```

    StmtList
      Call
        Ident "map"
        StmtList
          Ident "body"

But single stage with type parameter can be written using two different ways - both are **syntactically correct**, but have comparatively different parse trees:

```nim
dumpTree:
  map [a]:
    body
```

    StmtList
      Command
        Ident "map"
        Bracket
          Ident "a"
        StmtList
          Ident "body"

```nim
dumpTree:
  map[a]:
    body
```

    StmtList
      Call
        BracketExpr
          Ident "map"
          Ident "a"
        StmtList
          Ident "body"


## `fusion/matching`

Let's make a small digression in order to better understand how new pattern matching library can help us here.

We will be focusing on parts that are relevant to our task - for more details you can read <link to documentation>.

When writing nim macros you are mostly dealing with [NimNode](https://nim-lang.org/docs/macros.html#the-ast-in-nim) objects - first to process input AST, and then generate new code back. AST is comprised of [case objects](https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#types-object-variants). Usually, first part of the macro involves lots of checks for correct node kind, followed by iteration over subnodes to extract input data. Pattern matching simplifies this, allowing to directly write expected patterns for ast, with syntax closely matching that of `dumpTree`.

For example - if we have code like `map[string]` it has following tree representation:

```nim
dumpTree:
  map[string]
```

    StmtList
      BracketExpr
        Ident "map"
        Ident "string"

And can be matched using following pattern:

```nim
body.assertMatch:
  BracketExpr:
    @head
    @typeParam
```

Notice similarity between AST and pattern for matching - each node has `kind` field, which describes what kind of node this is. In this case we are interested in first and second subnodes of the `BracketExpr` node - flow stage kind and type parameter respectively.

As we have alreay seed earlier, `map [string]` and `map[string]` are parsed differently - first one is handled as one-element array passed to `map` function argument, and second is bracket expression (like accessing element of the array). This difference is caused by [method call syntax](https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#procedures-method-call-syntax) and usually makes programming DSL a little harder - you need to check for both alternatives, remember which index each capture should be in etc.

With pattern matching though it becomes quite easy to do - adding second alternative to match will be enough.

```nim
body.matches:
  # More compact way of writing `BracketExpr`
  BracketExpr[@head, @typeParam] |
  Command[@head, Bracket[@typeParam]]
```

It should also be possible to omit type parameters from DSL entirely - they are quite nice and would allow for better type checking, but could become quite annoying to write. So, we should also expect someone to just write `map` - without any type qualifications. To handle this case we add third alternative for pattern -

```nim
body.matches:
  BracketExpr[@head, @typeParam] |
  Command[@head, Bracket[@typeParam]] |
  @head is Ident()
```

This brings one important change `typeParam` capture is no longer `NimNode` - type has changed to `Option[NimNode]`, because not all alternatives have this variable. `head` is still a `NimNode` just as before - all possible alternatives contain this variable, so it would be set if input matches.

-------------------------------------------------------------

This example shows really well how pattern matching can help handling different alternative syntaxes. Another very powerful feature is sequence matching - sadly in this particular example we had no need for it, but I decided to still showcase it. Consider [procedure declaration](https://nim-lang.org/docs/macros.html#statements-procedure-declaration) ast - suppose we need to match name, arguments, and return type. Usually part of case statement would look similarly to this:

```nim
  let name = arg[0]
  let returnType = arg[3][0]
  let arguments = arg[3][1 .. ^1]
```

This is not particularly complicated, but with pattern matching it all transforms to

```nim
ProcDef[@name, _, _, [@returnType, all @arguments], .._]
```


## Flow macro implementation

Out first stage would be processing of all input into `FlowStage`. We already have a way to extract data from input ast - using pattern matching.

```nim
macro flow(arg, body: untyped): untyped =
  var stages: seq[FlowStage]
  for elem in body:
    if elem.matches(
        Call[BracketExpr[@ident, opt @outType], @body] |
        # `map[string]:`
        Command[@ident is Ident(), Bracket [@outType], @body] |
        # `map [string]:`
        Call[@ident is Ident(), @body]
        # just `map:`, without type argument
      ):
        stages.add FlowStage(
          kind: identToKind(ident),
          outputType: outType,
          body: body
        )
```

After that, we have all necessary information for generating result code. If last stage is not `each` - e.g. there is a return value after each iteration, we need to determine type of the result sequence and then append to it on each iteration.

```nim
if stages[^1].kind notin {fskEach}:
  # If last stage has return type (not `each`) then we need to
  # accumulate results in temporary variable.
  result = quote do:
    var `resId`: seq[#[ Type of the expression ]#]

    for it0 {.inject.} in `arg`:
      `resId`.add #[ Expression to evaluate]#

    `resId`
else:
  # Otherwise just iterate each element
  result = quote do:
    for it0 {.inject.} in `arg`:
      #[ Expression to evaluate ]#
```


### Get result type

Each stage of the dataflow has a type, and potentially defines variables. In addition to that - each stage uses special variable `it` - that has to be injected separately for each stage **but** at the same time it is used for commulicating values between stages.

```nim
flow [1,2,3]:
  map:
    it * 2
  map:
    $it
```

is equivalent to

```nim
var res: seq[#[ Type of the expression ]#]

for it in [1, 2, 3]:
  let it = it * 2
  let it = $it
  res.add it

res
```

As you can clearly see, such code would not even compile due to redefinition errors. There are two possible ways to solve this problem - kind of obvious, and not-all-that-obvious. Let's start with the first one - since each variable can be redefined in the new scope we can just do

```nim
for it in [1, 2, 3]:
  block:
    let it = it * 2
    block:
      let it = $it
      echo "Add result - ", it

```

    Add result - 2
    Add result - 4
    Add result - 6

And it would compile and work perfectly fine. But now we have a problem of getting type of the expression itself - everything is fine as long as you only use `map` - after all `block:` is an expression, and we can have something like

```nim
echo typeof((block:
               let it = 1
               block:
                 let it = it * 2
                 block: $it))
```

    string

Not the prettiest code in the world, by all means - but it will become even worse when we have to deal with `filter`, `each`, injected variables and iterators.

Second alternative is to use declare proc with `auto` return variable and assign result of the expression to it. In that case compiler will figure out return type for us.

```nim
proc hello[T](a: T): auto =
  for c in "ee":
    result = (12, "som", "ee", a)

echo typeof hello[int]
```

    proc (a: int): (int, string, string, int){.noSideEffect, gcsafe, locks: 0.}

Now we only need to write code generation for `#[ Expression to evaluate ]#` and substitute `result =` when necessary.


### Create evaluation expression

1.  Body rewrite

    Each stage in `flow` injects `it` variable - result of the evaluation from previous stage. To avoid getting redefinition errors from mulitiple `let it = <expression>` on each stage, we will replace each ocurrence of `it` with `it<stage-index>`. For the first stage it would be `it -> it1`, second one is `it -> it2` and so on.

    `rewrite` takes input `NimNode` and either returns it as-is (if no rewriting is necessary) or, in case of identifier `it` (`Ident(strVal: "it")`) convert it into new one with corresponding index.

    ```nim
    proc rewrite(node: NimNode, idx: int): NimNode =
      case node:
        of Ident(strVal: "it"):
          result = ident("it" & $idx)
        of (kind: in nnkTokenKinds): # `nnkTokenKinds` is a set of node
                                     # kinds that don't have subnodes.
                                     # These ones are returned without any
                                     # modifications.
          result = node
        else:
          # For node kinds with subnodes, rewriting must be done
          # recursively
          result = newTree(node.kind)
          for subn in node:
            result.add subn.rewrite(idx)
    ```

2.  Create eval expression

    For each stage we rewrite body, and then append new chunk of generated code to result.

    ```nim
    func evalExprFromStages(stages: seq[FlowStage]): NimNode =
      result = newStmtList()
      for idx, stage in stages:
        # Rewrite body
        let body = stage.body.rewrite(idx)


        case stage.kind:
          # If stage is a filter it is converted into `if` expression
          # and new new variables are injected.
          of fskFilter:
            result.add quote do:
              let stageOk = ((`body`))
              if not stageOk:
                continue

          of fskEach:
            # `each` has no variables or special formatting - just
            # rewrite body and paste it back to resulting code
            result.add body
          of fskMap:
            # Create new identifier for injected node and assign
            # result of `body` to it.
            let itId = ident("it" & $(idx + 1))
            result.add quote do:
              let `itId` = `body`

            # If output type for stage needs to be explicitly checked
            # create type assertion.
            if Some(@expType) ?= stage.outputType:
              result.add makeTypeAssert(expType, stage.body, itId)
    ```


### Result type implementation

```nim
func typeExprFromStages(stages: seq[FlowStage], arg: NimNode): NimNode =
  let evalExpr = evalExprFromStages(stages)
  var
    resTuple = nnkPar.newTree(ident "it0")

  for idx, stage in stages:
    if st.kind notin {fskFilter}:
      resTuple.add ident("it" & $(idx + 1))

  let lastId = newLit(stages.len - 1)

  result = quote do:
    block:
      (
        proc(): auto = # `auto` annotation allows to derive type
                       # of the proc from any assingment withing
                       # proc body - we take advantage of this,
                       # and avoid building type expression
                       # manually.
          for it0 {.inject.} in `arg`:
            `evalExpr`
            result = `resTuple`
#           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#           |
#           Type of the return will be derived from this assinment.
#           Even though it is placed within loop body, it will still
#           derive necessary return type
      )()[`lastId`]
#      ^^^^^^^^^^^^
#      | |
#      | Get last element from proc return type
#      |
#      After proc is declared we call it immediatey
```



### Final `flow` implementation

```nim
macro flow(arg, body: untyped): untyped =
  var stages: seq[FlowStage]
  for elem in body:
    if elem.matches(
        Call[BracketExpr[@ident, opt @outType], @body] |
        # `map[string]:`
        Command[@ident is Ident(), Bracket [@outType], @body] |
        # `map [string]:`
        Call[@ident is Ident(), @body]
        # just `map:`, without type argument
      ):
        stages.add FlowStage(
          kind: identToKind(ident),
          outputType: outType,
          body: body
        )

  let evalExpr = evalExprFromStages(stages)

  if stages[^1].kind notin {fskEach}:
    # If last stage has return type (not `each`) then we need to
    # accumulate results in temporary variable.
    let resExpr = typeExprFromStages(stages, arg)
    let lastId = ident("it" & $stages.len)
    let resId = ident("res")
    result = quote do:
      var `resId`: seq[typeof(`resExpr`)]

      for it0 {.inject.} in `arg`:
        `evalExpr`
        `resId`.add `lastid`

      `resId`
  else:
    result = quote do:
      for it0 {.inject.} in `arg`:
        `evalExpr`


  result = newBlockStmt(result)
```

Example of macro use

```nim
let res = flow lines("/etc/passwd"):
  map[seq[string]]:
    it.split(":")
  filter:
    let shell = it[^1]
    it.len > 1 and shell.endsWith("bash")
  map:
    shell
```

Generated code:

```nim
let res = block:
  var res: seq[typeof(block:
    # largely duplicated code for getting type of the expression.
    proc (): auto = for it0 in lines("/etc/passwd"):
      let it1 = split(it0, ":", -1)
      let stageOk`gensym10271 =
        let shell = it1[BackwardsIndex(1)]
          1 < len(it1) and
            endsWith(shell, "bash")
      if not stageOk`gensym10271:
        continue
      let it3 = shell
      result = (it0, it1, it3)()[2]
  )]

  # Actual implementation
  for it0 in lines("/etc/passwd"):
    let it1 = split(it0, ":", -1)
    let stageOk`gensym10267 =
      let shell = it1[BackwardsIndex(1)]
        1 < len(it1) and
          endsWith(shell, "bash")
    if not stageOk`gensym10267:
      continue
    let it3 = shell
    add(res, it3)
  res
```

Example of flow state mismatch error

```nim
let res = flow lines("/etc/passwd"):
  map[seq[char]]:
    it.split(":")
```

    Error:

    Expected type seq[char], but expression it.split(":") has type of seq[string]


## Notes

-   Implementation of this macro was largely inspired by `zero_functional` [library](https://github.com/zero-functional/zero-functional)
-   Full flow macro implementation can be seen [here](https://github.com/nim-lang/fusion/blob/ea18f8559c514b227b148300a2900b3e2a282b0d/tests/tmatching.nim#L1878) - it is a part of test suite for the library, but a lot of comments from the article are still present.
-   I tried to write test suite in a way that would make it easier to use as an example as well.
-   This library is still being developed - some minor bugs and inconsistencies could expected, as well as ergonomics improvements.
