The Nim team is happy to announce version 1.6.2, our first patch release for
Nim 1.6.

Version 1.6.2 is a result of two month of hard work, and it contains
[41 commits](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/compare/v1.6.0...v1.6.2),
fixing more than 15 reported issues and bringing some general improvements over 1.6.0.

We would recommend to all of our users to upgrade and use version 1.6.2.


# Installing Nim 1.6

## New users

Check out if the package manager of your OS already ships version 1.6.2 or
install it as described [here](https://nim-lang.org/install.html).


## Existing users

If you have installed a previous version of Nim using `choosenim`,
getting Nim 1.6.2 is as easy as:

```bash
$ choosenim update stable
```
