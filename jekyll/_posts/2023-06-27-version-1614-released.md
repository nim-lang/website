title: "Version 1.6.14 released"
author: The Nim Team
---

The Nim team is happy to announce version 1.6.14, our seventh (and largest) patch release for
Nim 1.6.

Version 1.6.14 is a result of three months of hard work, and it contains
[179 commits](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/compare/v1.6.12...v1.6.14),
bringing lots of general improvements over 1.6.12.

This release contains more than the usual amount of commits for a patch release
because we want to give you the best Nim v1 experience, in case you won't be able to
immediately switch to Nim v2, which will be our next release.

We would recommend to all of our users to upgrade and use version 1.6.14.




# Installing Nim 1.6

## New users

Check out if the package manager of your OS already ships version 1.6.14 or
install it as described [here](https://nim-lang.org/install.html).


## Existing users

If you have installed a previous version of Nim using `choosenim`,
getting Nim 1.6.14 is as easy as:

```bash
$ choosenim update stable
```

Alternatively, you can download Nim 1.6.14 from
[our nightlies builds](https://github.com/nim-lang/nightlies/releases/tag/2023-06-27-version-1-6-71ba2e7f3c5815d956b1ae0341b0743242b8fec6).
