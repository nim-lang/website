[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is an annual event happening in October which celebrates open source software and encourages meaningful contributions to the open source ecosystem.
To win a T-shirt, you must sign up on the [Hacktoberfest site](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) and make four pull requests to any repo on Github by the end of October.

Nim would like to encourage you to participate in Hacktoberfest by contributing to the [Nim repo](https://github.com/nim-lang/nim) or any other Nim-related repos and libraries.



# How can you help?

* bug-fixing
* improving documentation
* writing a library


## Bug fixing

[Nim repo](https://github.com/nim-lang/nim) has more than 1600 open issues, which might be overwhelming to start.
Here are some categories you might find interesting:

* Why don't you start with some of the [easy issues](https://github.com/nim-lang/nim/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AEasy)?
* Everybody uses the standard library. How about fixing one of the more than 150 issues in the [stdlib](https://github.com/nim-lang/nim/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AStdlib)?
* What are our priorities? Take a look at [high priority issues](https://github.com/nim-lang/nim/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A"High+Priority").


## Improving documentation

You don't want to write code?
Poor documentation is often mentioned when people discuss Nim.
Let's make it better together!

Plenty of issues involve [documentation](https://github.com/nim-lang/nim/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ADocumentation).

If you have noticed while using Nim that some modules could have a more detailed documentation, send a PR improving it.
Just fixing some typos also counts!


## Writing a library

There is a [list of needed libraries](https://github.com/nim-lang/needed-libraries/issues), can you help us shorten it?

Once you have written a library, you can send a PR to [nimble package repo](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble) to include your package in the official list of packages!

If writing a library seems like a too demanding task, you can help improve [one of the existing Nim packages](https://nimble.directory/) by adding a feature, fixing a bug, or writing more informative documentation.



# I want to help, but I've run into some problem

If you need any help, the Nim community is very welcoming.
Ask a question in [Nim's IRC Channel on Freenode](irc://freenode.net/nim), [on Discord](https://discord.gg/nim), [Nim's room on Gitter](https://gitter.im/nim-lang/Nim) or the [Nim Telegram group](https://t.me/nim_lang) and somebody will help you.
Other communication channels can be found on our [community page](https://nim-lang.org/community.html).

Happy coding!
