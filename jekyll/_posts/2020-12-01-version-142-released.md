title: "Version 1.4.2 released"
author: The Nim Team
---

The Nim team is happy to announce version 1.4.2, our first patch release for
Nim 1.4.

Version 1.4.2 is a result of one month of hard work, and it contains
[229 commits](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/compare/v1.4.0...v1.4.2),
fixing more than 90 reported issues.

This is a large patch release, bringing lots of bugfixes and improvements
that didn't make it for the 1.4.0 release.

If you are still on Nim 1.0.x, and would like to know about new features
available in Nim 1.2 and 1.4, check out our
[version 1.2.0 release article](https://nim-lang.org/blog/2020/04/03/version-120-released.html) and
[version 1.4.0 release article](https://nim-lang.org/blog/2020/10/16/version-140-released.html).

We would recommend to all of our users to upgrade and use version 1.4.2.


# Installing Nim 1.4

## New users

Check out if the package manager of your OS already ships version 1.4.2 or
install it as described [here](https://nim-lang.org/install.html).


## Existing users

If you have installed a previous version of Nim using `choosenim`,
getting Nim 1.4.2 is as easy as:

```bash
$ choosenim update stable
```

Alternatively, you can download Nim 1.4.2 from
[our nightlies builds](https://github.com/nim-lang/nightlies/releases/tag/2020-11-30-version-1-4-3fb5157ab1b666a5a5c34efde0f357a82d433d04).



# Donating to Nim

We would like to encourage you to donate to Nim.

The donated money will be used to further improve Nim:
- Bugs need to be fixed, the documentation can be improved, compiler error
  messages can always be better.
- The most exciting upcoming feature, that has the greatest impact to all
  of our users, is [incremental compilation](https://github.com/nim-lang/RFCs/issues/46).
- Incremental compilation will also be the foundation for further tooling
  improvements like `nimsuggest` (autocompletion, find usages).
