# Zen of Nim

<!--it makes sense to have the final set of rules explicit as first thing-->

1. Copying bad design is not good design.
2. If the compiler cannot reason about the code, neither can the programmer.
3. Don't get in the programmer's way.
4. Move work to compile-time: Programs are run more often than they are compiled.
5. Customizable memory management.
6. Concise code is not in conflict with readability, it enables readability.
7. (Leverage meta programming to keep the language small.)
8. Optimization is specialization: When you need more speed, write custom code.
9. There should be one and only one programming language for everything. That language is Nim.

## Introduction

In this blog post I will explain the philosophy of Nim language and why Nim can be useful for a wide range of application domains, such as:

- scientific computing
- games
- compilers
- operating systems development
- scripting
- everything else

<!-- could be nice to add links to other nim conf talks related to these domains-->

"Zen" means that we will arrive at a set of rules (shown above) that guide the language design and evolution, but I will go through these rules via examples.

## Syntax

Nim has an **indentation based syntax** as inspired by Haskell or Python that **fits Nim's macro system**.
