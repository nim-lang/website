# Zen of Nim

<!--it makes sense to have the final set of rules explicit as first thing, should add an editor's note here-->

1. Copying bad design is not good design.
2. If the compiler cannot reason about the code, neither can the programmer.
3. Don't get in the programmer's way.
4. Move work to compile-time: Programs are run more often than they are compiled.
5. Customizable memory management.
6. Concise code is not in conflict with readability, it enables readability.
7. (Leverage meta programming to keep the language small.)
8. Optimization is specialization: When you need more speed, write custom code.
9. There should be one and only one programming language for everything. That language is Nim.

# Introduction

In this blog post I will explain the philosophy of Nim language and why Nim can be useful for a wide range of application domains, such as:

- scientific computing
- games
- compilers
- operating systems development
- scripting
- everything else

<!-- could be nice to add links to other nim conf talks related to these domains-->

"Zen" means that we will arrive at a set of rules (shown above) that guide the language design and evolution, but I will go through these rules via examples.

<!--
Overview of structure:
- syntax provides context for rule 6: concise code enables readability
- then big section on rule 2: compilers must be able to reason about code
- then rule 1 (copying bad design ...) is used to justify macro system (and possibly this also justifies rule 4?)
- then a section for rule 3 (don't get in programmer's way)
- a section on rule 5 (customizable memory management)
- rule 7, 8 and 9 are only mentioned in the final summary
-->
# Syntax

Nim has an **indentation based syntax** as inspired by Haskell or Python that **fits Nim's macro system**.


## Function application

Nim distinguish between statements and expressions and most of the time an expression is function application (or procedure call).
Function application uses the traditional mathy syntax with the parentheses: `f()`, `f(a)`, `f(a, b)`.

And here is the sugar:

|   |  Sugar     |   Meaning           |   Example                      |
|---|------------|---------------------|--------------------------------|
| 1 |  `f a`     |   `f(a)`            |   `spawn log("some message")`  |
| 2 |  `f a, b`  |   `f(a, b)`         |   `echo "hello ", "world"`     |
| 3 |  `a.f()`   |   `f(a)`            |   `db.fetchRow()`              |
| 4 |  `a.f`     |   `f(a)`            |   `mystring.len`               |
| 5 |  `a.f(b)`  |   `f(a, b)`         |   `myarray.map(f)`             |
| 6 |  `a.f b`   |   `f(a, b)`         |   `db.fetchRow 1`              |
| 7 |  `f"\n"`   |   `f(r"\n")`        |   `re"\b[a-z*]\b"`             |
| 8 |  `f a: b`  |   `f(a, b)`         |   `lock x: echo "hi"`          |


* in rules 1 and 2 you can leave out the parentheses and there are examples so that you can see why that might be useful: `spawn` looks like a keyword, which is good, since it does something special; `echo` is also famous for leaving out the parentheses because usually you write these statements for debugging, thus you are in a hurry to get things done;
* you have dot notations available and you can leave out parentheses (rules 3-6);
* rule 7 is about string literals: `f` followed by a string without whitespace is still a call but the  string is turned into a raw string literal,
  which is very handy for regular expressions because regular expressions have their own idea of what a backslash is supposed to mean;
* finally in the last rule we can see that you can pass a block a block of code to the `f` with a `:` syntax and the cide block is usually the last argument you pass to the function and this can be used to create custom `lock` statement;
* there is one **exception** to leaving out the parentheses, in the case you want to refer to `f` directly: `f` does not mean `f()`. In the case of `myarray.map(f)` you do not want to invoke `f`, instead you want to pass the `f` itself to `map`.

## Operators

Nim has binary and unary operators:

* Most of the time binary operators are simply invoked as `x @ y`
  and unary operators as `@x`.
* No explicit distinction between operators and functions and between binary and unary operators.

```nim
func `++`(x: var int; y: int = 1; z: int = 0) =
  x = x + y + z

var g = 70
++g
g ++ 7
# operator in backticks is treated like an 'f':
g.`++`(10, 20)
echo g  # writes 108
```

* operators are simply sugar for functions
* the operator token goes inside backticks (e.g. `++`) when the function is defined and it can be called as a function using backticks notation.
  
Recall that `var` keyword indicates mutability:
* parameters are readonly unless declared as `var`
* `var` means "pass by reference" (implemented with a hidden pointer)


## Statements vs expressions

Statements require indentation:

```nim
# no indentation needed for single assignment statement:
if x: x = false

# indentation needed for nested if statement:
if x:
  if y:
    y = false
else:
  y = true

# indentation needed, because two statements
# follow the condition:
if x:
  x = false
  y = false
```

You can also use semicolons instead of new lines but this is very uncommon in Nim.

<!-- should we add an example for semicolons? something like the python-walrus-equivalent syntax as in: https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/4637#28963 -->

Expressions are not really based on indentation so you are free to use additional white space within expressions:

```nim
if thisIsaLongCondition() and
    thisIsAnotherLongCondition(1,
        2, 3, 4):
  x = true
```

This can be very handy for breaking up long lines, as a rule of thumb you have optional indentation after operators, `(` and `,`.

Finally `if`, `case`, etc statements are also available as expressions, so they can produce a value.

As a simple example to conclude this section about syntax,
here is a full nim program to show a little bit more of syntax.
If you are familiar with Python, this should be straightforward to read:

```nim
func indexOf(s: string; x: set[char]): int =
  for i in 0..<s.len:
    if s[i] in x: return i
  return -1

let whitespacePos = indexOf("abc def", {' ', '\t'})
echo whitespacePos
```

* nim uses static typing, so the parameters have types attached: the input parameter named `s` has type `string`;
  `x` has type set of characters; the function called `indexOf` produces an integer value as final result.
* you can iterate over the string index via the `for` loop, the goal is to find the position of the first character
  inside the string that matches the given set of values. We construct a set of whitespaces using `{}`.

Our first rule in our Zen of Nim discussion is:

<div class="zen-rule"><!-- visualized as bigger font inside a rouded box? -->
Concise code is not in conflict with readability, it enables readability.
</div>

As you can see in the above tiny example, it is very easy to follow and to read because we basically leave out the symbols
that carry little meaning, such as curly braces for blocks or semicolons to terminate the statements.
This scales up, so in longer programs it is really helpful when you have less code to look at because then you can
more easily figure out how the code is supposed to work or what it can do without getting too much details.

Usually the argument is like: "the syntax is terse, so it is unreadable and all you want to do is to save typing work";
in my opinion this totally misses the point, it is not about saving keystrokes or saving typing effort,
it is saving the effort when you look at the resulting code.
Programs are read way more often than they are written and when you read them it really helps if they are shorter.

## Compiler

A second rule would be:

<div class="zen-rule">
The compiler must be able to reason about the code
</div>

This means we want:

- Structured programming.
- Static typing!
- Static binding!
- Side effects tracking.
- Exception tracking.
- Mutability restrictions.
- Value based datatypes. (Aliasing is very hard to reason about!)


### Structured programming

```nim
import tables, strutils

proc countWords(filename: string): CountTable[string] =
  ## Counts all the words in the file.
  result = initCountTable[string]()
  for word in readFile(filename).split:
    result.inc word
  # 'result' instead of 'return', no unstructed control flow
```

<!-- nim offers the return statement but we advise you not to use it, since that is unstructured programming

structured programming means you have a single entry point and exit point in the code.
-->


```nim
for item in collection:
  if item.isBad: continue
  # what do we know here at this point?
  use item
```

<!--
compare with the following. you can use continue but it is not advised
more importantly it means we will never add a more general goto statement 
-->

```nim
for item in collection:
  if not item.isBad:
    # what do we know here at this point?
    # that the item is not bad.
    use item
```

<!-- we want to be in a position to prove more and more stuff about your code
and structured programming makes it easier-->

### Static typing

distinct & enums & sets

<!-- we really want you to use custom types adapted to the problem domain-->

```nim
type
  SandboxFlag = enum         ## what the interpreter should allow
    allowCast,               ## allow unsafe language feature: 'cast'
    allowFFI,                ## allow the FFI
    allowInfiniteLoops       ## allow endless loops

  NimCode = distinct string

proc runNimCode(code: NimCode; flags: set[SandboxFlag] = {allowCast, allowFFI}) =
  ...
```
<!--
if you compare with the C example you lose the type safety

and you lose information on what are valid values and the compiler cannot help
-->

```c
#define allowCast (1 << 0)
#define allowFFI (1 << 1)
#define allowInfiniteLoops (1 << 2)

void runNimCode(char* code, unsigned int flags = allowCast|allowFFI);

runNimCode("4+5", 700); // nobody stops us from passing 700
```

### Static binding

<!---->

```nim
echo "hello ", "world", 99
```

is rewritten to:

```nim
echo([$"hello ", $"world", $99])
```

- echo is declared as: ``proc echo(a: varargs[string, `$`]);``
- `$` (Nim's `toString` operator) is applied to every argument
- overloading instead of dynamic binding


- it is extensible:

```nim
proc `$`(x: MyObject): string = x.s
var obj = MyObject(s: "xyz")
echo obj  # works
```

### Value based datatypes

<!-- wrt to functional languages you want to restrict aliasing instead of mutation
because mutation is efficient-->

```nim
type
  Rect = object
    x, y, w, h: int

# construction:
let r = Rect(x: 12, y: 22, w: 40, h: 80)

# field access:
echo r.x, " ", r.y

# assignment does copy:
var other = r
other.x = 10
assert r.x == 12
```

<!-- no spooky action at a distance -->

### Side effects tracking

```nim
import strutils

proc count(s: string, sub: string): int {.noSideEffect.} =
  result = 0
  var i = 0
  while true:
    i = s.find(sub, i)
    if i < 0: break
    echo "i is: ", i  # error: 'echo' can have side effects
    i += sub.len
    inc result
```

<!-- the compiler is smart and helps you, but sometimes you need to override-->

```nim
import strutils

proc count(s: string, sub: string): int {.noSideEffect.} =
  result = 0
  var i = 0
  while true:
    i = s.find(sub, i)
    if i < 0: break
    {.cast(noSideEffect).}:
      echo "i is: ", i  # 'cast', so go ahead
    i += sub.len
    inc result
```

<!--cast means: I know what I am doing-->

### Exception tracking

```nim
import os

proc main() {.raises: [].} =
  copyDir("from", "to")
  # Error: copyDir("from", "to") can raise an
  # unlisted exception: ref OSError
```

```nim
import os

proc main() {.raises: [OSError].} =
  copyDir("from", "to")
  # compiles :-)
```

<!--
I was really surprised that this worked out of the box (probably because somebody else helped me out and fixed this bug)
-->

```nim
proc x[E]() {.raises: [E].} =
  raise newException(E, "text here")

try:
  x[ValueError]()
except ValueError:
  echo "good"
```

### Mutability restrictions

```nim
{.experimental: "strictFuncs".}

type
  Node = ref object
    next, prev: Node
    data: string

func len(n: Node): int =
  var it = n
  result = 0
  while it != nil:
    inc result
    it = it.next
```

<!--
crucial part is that with strictFuncs we ...
-->

```nim
{.experimental: "strictFuncs".}

func insert(x: var seq[Node]; y: Node) =
  let L = x.len
  x.setLen L + 1
  x[L] = y


func doesCompile(n: Node) =
  var m = Node()
  m.data = "abc"
```

<!-- semantics: you cannot mutate  -->

```nim
{.experimental: "strictFuncs".}

func doesNotCompile(n: Node) =
  n.data = "abc"
```

<!-- we can try to trick the compiler -->

```nim
{.experimental: "strictFuncs".}

func select(a, b: Node): Node = b

func mutate(n: Node) =
  var it = n
  let x = it
  let y = x
  let z = y # <-- is the statement that connected
            # the mutation to the parameter

  select(x, z).data = "tricky" # <-- the mutation is here
  # Error: an object reachable from 'n'
  # is potentially mutated
```

<!-- what it does internally, it has a notion of a graph, ... 


this all is summarized in:

neither can the programmer.</big></big></big></big></center>



## 1. Copying bad design is not good design

Bad: Language X has feature F, let's have that too!

("C++ has compile-time function evaluation, let's have that too!")

Good: We have many use cases for feature F.

<!-- in this case F is macro system -->

> ("We need to be able to do locking, logging, lazy evaluation,
> a typesafe Writeln/Printf, a declarative UI description language,
> async and parallel programming! So instead of building these
> features into the language, let's have a macro system.")


### Meta programming features

Templates for lazy evaluation:

```nim
template log(msg: string) =
  if debug:
    echo msg

log("x: " & $x & ", y: " & $y)
```

Roughly comparable to:

```c
#define log(msg) \
  if (debug) { \
    print(msg); \
  }

log("x: " + x.toString() + ", y: " + y.toString());
```

<!-- usual would be to evaluate an expression and call the function -->

Templates for control flow abstraction:

<!-- in C# it is a language primitive, in nim you implement it with a template -->

```nim
template withLock(lock, body) =
  var lock: Lock
  try:
    acquire lock
    body
  finally:
    release lock

withLock myLock:
  accessProtectedResource()
```

Macros to implement DSLs:

```nim
html mainPage:
  head:
    title "Zen of Nim"
  body:
    ul:
      li "A bunch of rules that make no sense."

echo mainPage()
```

Produces::

```html
<html>
  <head><title>Zen of Nim</title></head>
  <body>
    <ul>
      <li>A bunch of rules that make no sense.</li>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
```


#### Lifting

```nim
import math

template liftFromScalar(fname) =
  proc fname[T](x: openArray[T]): seq[T] =
    result = newSeq[typeof(x[0])](x.len)
    for i in 0..<x.len:
      result[i] = fname(x[i])

# make sqrt() work for sequences:
liftFromScalar(sqrt)
echo sqrt(@[4.0, 16.0, 25.0, 36.0])
# => @[2.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0]
```


#### Declarative programming

<!-- you can use templates to turn imperative into declarative programming -->

```nim
proc threadTests(r: var Results, cat: Category,
                  options: string) =
  template test(filename: untyped) =
    testSpec r, makeTest("tests/threads" / filename,
      options, cat, actionRun)
    testSpec r, makeTest("tests/threads" / filename,
      options & " -d:release", cat, actionRun)
    testSpec r, makeTest("tests/threads" / filename,
      options & " --tlsEmulation:on", cat, actionRun)

  test "tactors"
  test "tactors2"
  test "threadex"
```

#### Varargs

```nim
test "tactors"
test "tactors2"
test "threadex"
```

```nim
test "tactors", "tactors2", "threadex"
```

```nim
import macros

macro apply(caller: untyped;
            args: varargs[untyped]): untyped =
  result = newStmtList()
  for a in args:
    result.add(newCall(caller, a))

apply test, "tactors", "tactors2", "threadex"
```

<!-- details are not important and ... -->

#### Typesafe Writeln/Printf

```nim
proc write(f: File; a: int) = echo a
proc write(f: File; a: bool) = echo a
proc write(f: File; a: float) = echo a

proc writeNewline(f: File) =
  echo "\n"

macro writeln*(f: File; args: varargs[typed]) =
  result = newStmtList()
  for a in args:
    result.add newCall(bindSym"write", f, a)
  result.add newCall(bindSym"writeNewline", f)
```

## 3. Don't get in the programmer's way

<!-- yes, the compiler is smart but don't get in the programmer's way -->

- Interoperability with C++, C and JavaScript.
- By compiling Nim to these languages.
- Low level features are available:

  * Bit twiddling
  * unsafe type conversions ("cast")
  * raw pointers.

<!--
the philosophy is not let's use C++ and Nim because Nim does have a particular feature
interfacing with C++ is last resort but then real world kicks in

ideally you only use nim language
-->

### Emit pragma

<!-- the interoperability story goes so far that we  -->

```nim
{.emit: """
static int cvariable = 420;
""".}

proc embedsC() =
  var nimVar = 89
  {.emit: ["""fprintf(stdout, "%d\n", cvariable + (int)""",
    nimVar, ");"].}

embedsC()
```

<!--
we want you to be able to get things done
we want the language to be practical
-->


<!-- transtion to talk about memory management, still under don't get in programmer way? no!-->

## 5. Customizable memory management

### Sink parameters

<!-- destructor and ownerships are hopefully familiar from C++ and Rust -->

```nim
func f(x: sink string) =
  discard "do nothing"

f "abc"
```

Compile with `nim c --gc:orc --expandArc:f $file`

<!-- did I produce a memory leak? show me ... -->

```nim
func f(x: sink string) =
  discard "do nothing"
  `=destroy`(x)
```

**Nim's intermediate language is Nim itself.**

a different example:

```nim
var g: string

proc f(x: sink string) =
  g = x

f "abc"
```

we ask the compiler what does it do:

```nim
var g: string

proc f(x: sink string) =
  `=sink`(g, x)

f "abc"
```

<!-- x was moved into g and then it was destructed but compiler optimized -->

```nim
var g: string

proc f(x: sink string) =
  `=sink`(g, x)
  # optimized out:
  wasMoved(x)
  `=destroy`(x)

f "abc"
```

Destructors

```nim
type
  myseq*[T] = object
    len, cap: int
    data: ptr UncheckedArray[T]

proc `=destroy`*[T](x: var myseq[T]) =
  if x.data != nil:
    for i in 0..<x.len: `=destroy`(x[i])
    dealloc(x.data)
```

Move operator

```nim
proc `=sink`*[T](a: var myseq[T]; b: myseq[T]) =
  # move assignment, optional.
  # Compiler is using `=destroy` and
  # `copyMem` when not provided
  `=destroy`(a)
  a.len = b.len
  a.cap = b.cap
  a.data = b.data
```

Assignment operator

```nim
proc `=copy`*[T](a: var myseq[T]; b: myseq[T]) =
  # do nothing for self-assignments:
  if a.data == b.data: return
  `=destroy`(a)
  a.len = b.len
  a.cap = b.cap
  if b.data != nil:
    a.data = cast[typeof(a.data)](
      alloc(a.cap * sizeof(T)))
    for i in 0..<a.len:
      a.data[i] = b.data[i]
```

<!-- this accessors part is not discussed during presentation -->
Accessors

```nim
proc add*[T](x: var myseq[T]; y: sink T) =
  if x.len >= x.cap: resize(x)
  x.data[x.len] = y
  inc x.len

proc `[]`*[T](x: myseq[T]; i: Natural): lent T =
  assert i < x.len
  x.data[i]

proc `[]=`*[T](x: var myseq[T]; i: Natural; y: sink T) =
  assert i < x.len
  x.data[i] = y
```

Customizable memory management

# Zen of Nim

- Copying bad design is not good design.
- If the compiler cannot reason about the code, neither can the programmer.
- Don't get in the programmer's way.
- Move work to compile-time: Programs are run more often than they are compiled.
- Customizable memory management.
- Concise code is not in conflict with readability, it enables readability.
- (Leverage meta programming to keep the language small.)
- Optimization is specialization: When you need more speed, write custom code.
- There should be one and only one programming language for everything. That language is Nim.

<!-- there is friction between we want the language to be complete vs we want

optimization is specialization: was not covered before. when you need more speed.
-->
