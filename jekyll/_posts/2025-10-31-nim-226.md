title: "Nim version 2.2.6 released"
author: The Nim Team

The Nim Team is happy to announce version 2.2.6, the third patch release for our stable release, Nim 2.2.

It comes six months after the 2.2.4 release and it contains [141 commits](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/compare/v2.2.4...v2.2.6), bringing bugfixes and improvements.

If you're still on Nim 1.6, take a look at the [version 2.0 release article](https://nim-lang.org/blog/2023/08/01/nim-v20-released.html) to see all the features you're missing.
If you've been using Nim 2.0, the [version 2.2 release article](https://nim-lang.org/blog/2024/10/02/nim-220-2010.html) shows the improvements available in Nim 2.2.

The Nim 2.2.6 changelog is available [here](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/blob/v2.2.6/changelog.md).




## Highlights

Exception handling combined with Nim's `async` is more stable than ever before
as the underlying closure iterator transformation has been rewritten.

The compiler is now smart enough to produce a move operation for `return obj.field`.
Previously it performed a copy.
Expect your code to run slightly faster due to this and other minor performance improvements.




## Installing Nim 2.2.6


Check out if the package manager of your OS already ships version 2.2.6 or
install it as described [here](https://nim-lang.org/install.html).

If you have installed a previous version of Nim using `choosenim`,
getting Nim 2.2.6 is as easy as:

```bash
$ choosenim update self
$ choosenim update stable
```

**NOTE:** We recommend you to install and use the latest version of `choosenim`, v.0.8.16, available in [our choosenim repo](https://github.com/nim-lang/choosenim).

Alternatively, you can download Nim 2.2.6 from
[our nightlies builds](https://github.com/nim-lang/nightlies/releases/tag/2025-10-31-version-2-2-ab00c56904e3126ad826bb520d243513a139436a).
