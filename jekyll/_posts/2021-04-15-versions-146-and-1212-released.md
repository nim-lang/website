title: "Versions 1.4.6 and 1.2.12 released"
author: The Nim Team
---

The Nim team is happy to announce the double patch release of versions 1.2.12 and 1.4.6.

Version 1.4.6 is our main release, which brings several improvements over
1.4.4, released a month ago.
As our [Community Survey](https://nim-lang.org/blog/2021/01/20/community-survey-results-2020.html)
has shown, most of our users use 1.4.x version, and this release is for them
and for all newcomers: we recommend you to install version 1.4.6.

We didn't forget the users who are still on the older versions and cannot
update to the latest stable version.
Version 1.2.12 is for them, and contains mostly just security fixes.
You can find more information about this version at the bottom of the article.

If you are still on Nim 1.2.x, and would like to know about new features
available in Nim 1.4, check out our
[version 1.4.0 release article](https://nim-lang.org/blog/2020/10/16/version-140-released.html).

# Donating to Nim

We would like to encourage you to donate to Nim.

The donated money will be used to further improve Nim:
- Bugs need to be fixed, the documentation can be improved, compiler error
  messages can always be better.
- The most exciting upcoming feature, that has the greatest impact to all
  of our users, is [incremental compilation](https://github.com/nim-lang/RFCs/issues/46).
- Incremental compilation will also be the foundation for further tooling
  improvements like `nimsuggest` (autocompletion, find usages).
