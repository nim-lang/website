title: "Version 2.0.0 RC2"
author: The Nim Team
---

The second release candidate (RC2) for Nim version 2.0 is ready for testing.

Don't panic! One of our design goals was to make it easy to write code that works with Nim version 1 and 2.
Many important packages already work with version 2 and as usual many innovations are behind switches
that can be enabled or disabled on a per module level thanks to the `.experimental` pragma.

Version 2 is based on the same codebase as version 1, it's an evolution, not a revolution.


Compared to the RC1, we have many ORC-related bugfixes,
but the most crucial difference for ordinary users
are the vastly improved error messages:

```nim
proc foo(s: string) = discard
proc foo(x, y: int) = discard
proc foo(c: char) = discard

foo 4
```

produces:
```
temp3.nim(11, 1) Error: type mismatch
Expression: foo 4
  [1] 4: int literal(4)

Expected one of (first mismatch at [position]):
[1] proc foo(c: char)
[1] proc foo(s: string)
[2] proc foo(x, y: int)
```




## Why use Nim?

If you are regular Nim user, you already know Nim's features.
On the other hand, if you waited until version 2.0 to explore Nim, here are some of its key strengths:

* One language to rule them all: from [shell scripting](https://nim-lang.org/docs/nims.html) to
  [web frontend and backend](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimforum),
  [scientific computing](https://github.com/SciNim),
  [deep learning](https://github.com/mratsim/Arraymancer),
  [blockchain client](https://github.com/status-im),
  [gamedev](https://github.com/ftsf/nico),
  [embedded](https://github.com/EmbeddedNim), see also some
  [companies using Nim](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/wiki/Organizations-using-Nim).
* Concise, readable and convenient: `echo "hello world"` is a 1-liner.
* Small binaries: `echo "hello world"` generates a 73K binary (or 5K with further options),
  optimized for embedded devices (Go: 2MB, Rust: 377K, C++: 56K) [1].
* Fast compile times: a full compiler rebuild takes ~12s (Rust: 15min, gcc: 30min+, clang: 1hr+, Go: 90s) [2].
* Native performance: see [Web Frameworks Benchmark](https://web-frameworks-benchmark.netlify.app/result),
  [ray tracing](https://nim-lang.org/blog/2020/06/30/ray-tracing-in-nim.html),
  [primes](https://github.com/PlummersSoftwareLLC/Primes).
* No need for makefiles, cmake, configure or other build scripts, thanks to compile-time
  function evaluation (CTFE) and dependency tracking [3].
* Target any platform with a C compiler:
  [Android and iOS](https://github.com/pragmagic/godot-nim#made-with-godot-nim),
  [embedded systems](https://github.com/elcritch/nesper),
  [micro-controllers](https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/7731),
  [WASM](https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/4779), Nintendo Switch,
  [Game Boy Advance](https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/8375).
* Zero-overhead interop lets you reuse code in C, C++ (including templates,
  [C++ STL](https://clonkk.github.io/nim-cppstl/cppstl.html)), JS, Objective-C,
  Python (via [nimpy](https://github.com/yglukhov/nimpy)).
* Built-in [documentation generator](https://nim-lang.github.io/Nim/system.html)
  that understands Nim code and runnable examples that stay in sync.

Last but not least, macros let you manipulate/generate code at compile time instead
of relying on code generators, enabling writing DSLs and language extensions in user code.
Typical examples include implementing Python-like
[f-strings](https://nim-lang.github.io/Nim/strformat.html),
[optional chaining](https://nim-lang.github.io/Nim/wrapnils.html),
[command line generators](https://github.com/c-blake/cligen),
React-like [Single Page Apps](https://github.com/karaxnim/karax),
[protobuf serialization and binding generators](https://github.com/PMunch/protobuf-nim).

# Contributors to Nim 2.0

Many thanks to our recurring and new
[contributors](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/graphs/contributors?from=2021-09-25&to=2023-03-30&type=c).
Nim is a community driven collaborative effort that welcomes all contributions, big or small.




# Backward compatibility

- `httpclient.contentLength` default to `-1` if the Content-Length header is not set in the response.
  It follows Apache HttpClient(Java), http(go) and .Net HttpWebResponse(C#) behavior. Previously it raised `ValueError`.

- `addr` is now available for all addressable locations,
  `unsafeAddr` is now deprecated and an alias for `addr`.

- Certain definitions from the default `system` module have been moved to
  the following new modules:

  - `std/syncio`
  - `std/assertions`
  - `std/formatfloat`
  - `std/objectdollar`
  - `std/widestrs`
  - `std/typedthreads`
  - `std/sysatomics`

  In the future, these definitions will be removed from the `system` module,
  and their respective modules will have to be imported to use them.
  Currently, to make these imports required, the `-d:nimPreviewSlimSystem` option
  may be used.

- Enabling `-d:nimPreviewSlimSystem` also removes the following deprecated
  symbols in the `system` module:
  - Aliases with `Error` suffix to exception types that have a `Defect` suffix
    (see [exceptions](https://nim-lang.github.io/Nim/exceptions.html)):
    `ArithmeticError`, `DivByZeroError`, `OverflowError`,
    `AccessViolationError`, `AssertionError`, `OutOfMemError`, `IndexError`,
    `FieldError`, `RangeError`, `StackOverflowError`, `ReraiseError`,
    `ObjectAssignmentError`, `ObjectConversionError`, `FloatingPointError`,
    `FloatOverflowError`, `FloatUnderflowError`, `FloatInexactError`,
    `DeadThreadError`, `NilAccessError`
  - `addQuitProc`, replaced by `exitprocs.addExitProc`
  - Legacy unsigned conversion operations: `ze`, `ze64`, `toU8`, `toU16`, `toU32`
  - `TaintedString`, formerly a distinct alias to `string`
  - `PInt32`, `PInt64`, `PFloat32`, `PFloat64`, aliases to
    `ptr int32`, `ptr int64`, `ptr float32`, `ptr float64`

- Enabling `-d:nimPreviewSlimSystem` removes the import of `channels_builtin` in
  in the `system` module.

- Enabling `-d:nimPreviewCstringConversion`, `ptr char`, `ptr array[N, char]` and `ptr UncheckedArray[N, char]` don't support conversion to cstring anymore.

- The `gc:v2` option is removed.

- The `mainmodule` and `m` options are removed.

- The `threads:on` option is now the default.

- Optional parameters in combination with `: body` syntax (RFC #405) are now opt-in via
  `experimental:flexibleOptionalParams`.

- Automatic dereferencing (experimental feature) is removed.

- The `Math.trunc` polyfill for targeting Internet Explorer was
  previously included in most JavaScript output files.
  Now, it is only included with `-d:nimJsMathTruncPolyfill`.
  If you are targeting Internet Explorer, you may choose to enable this option
  or define your own `Math.trunc` polyfill using the [`emit` pragma](https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#implementation-specific-pragmas-emit-pragma).
  Nim uses `Math.trunc` for the division and modulo operators for integers.

- `shallowCopy` and `shallow` are removed for ARC/ORC. Use `move` when possible or combine assignment and
`sink` for optimization purposes.

- The experimental `nimPreviewDotLikeOps` switch is going to be removed or deprecated because it didn't fullfill its promises.

- The `{.this.}` pragma, deprecated since 0.19, has been removed.
- `nil` literals can no longer be directly assigned to variables or fields of `distinct` pointer types. They must be converted instead.
  ```nim
  type Foo = distinct ptr int

  # Before:
  var x: Foo = nil
  # After:
  var x: Foo = Foo(nil)
  ```

- Removed two type pragma syntaxes deprecated since 0.20, namely
  `type Foo = object {.final.}`, and `type Foo {.final.} [T] = object`.

- `foo a = b` now means `foo(a = b)` rather than `foo(a) = b`. This is consistent
  with the existing behavior of `foo a, b = c` meaning `foo(a, b = c)`.
  This decision was made with the assumption that the old syntax was used rarely;
  if your code used the old syntax, please be aware of this change.

- [Overloadable enums](https://nim-lang.github.io/Nim/manual.html#overloadable-enum-value-names) and Unicode Operators
  are no longer experimental.

- Removed the `nimIncrSeqV3` define.

- `macros.getImpl` for `const` symbols now returns the full definition node
  (as `nnkConstDef`) rather than the AST of the constant value.

- Lock levels are deprecated, now a noop.

- ORC is now the default memory management strategy. Use
  `--mm:refc` for a transition period.

- `strictEffects` are no longer experimental.
  Use `legacy:laxEffects` to keep backward compatibility.

- The `gorge`/`staticExec` calls will now return a descriptive message in the output
  if the execution fails for whatever reason. To get back legacy behaviour use `-d:nimLegacyGorgeErrors`.

- Pointer to `cstring` conversion now triggers a `[PtrToCstringConv]` warning.
  This warning will become an error in future versions! Use a `cast` operation
  like `cast[cstring](x)` instead.

- `logging` will default to flushing all log level messages. To get the legacy behaviour of only flushing Error and Fatal messages, use `-d:nimV1LogFlushBehavior`.

- Redefining templates with the same signature was previously
  allowed to support certain macro code. To do this explicitly, the
  `{.redefine.}` pragma has been added. Note that this is only for templates.
  Implicit redefinition of templates is now deprecated and will give an error in the future.

- Using an unnamed break in a block is deprecated. This warning will become an error in future versions! Use a named block with a named break instead.

- Several Standard libraries are moved to nimble packages, use `nimble` to install them:
  - `std/punycode` => `punycode`
  - `std/asyncftpclient` => `asyncftpclient`
  - `std/smtp` => `smtp`
  - `std/db_common` => `db_connector/db_common`
  - `std/db_sqlite` => `db_connector/db_sqlite`
  - `std/db_mysql` => `db_connector/db_mysql`
  - `std/db_postgres` => `db_connector/db_postgres`
  - `std/db_odbc` => `db_connector/db_odbc`

- Previously, calls like `foo(a, b): ...` or `foo(a, b) do: ...` where the final argument of
  `foo` had type `proc ()` were assumed by the compiler to mean `foo(a, b, proc () = ...)`.
  This behavior is now deprecated. Use `foo(a, b) do (): ...` or `foo(a, b, proc () = ...)` instead.




# Major new features

Version 2.0 is a major new release with many additions and changes. We focus here on the most important
aspects:



## ORC is the new default

`--mm:orc` is now the default memory management strategy. It has been described multiple times now see, for example [here](https://nim-lang.org/blog/2022/11/11/a-cost-model-for-nim.html)
or [here](https://nim-lang.org/blog/2020/10/15/introduction-to-arc-orc-in-nim.html).



## Overloadable enums

[Overloadable enums](https://nim-lang.github.io/Nim/manual.html#overloadable-enum-value-names) are no longer experimental.

For example:

```nim
type
  E1 = enum
    value1, value2
  E2 = enum
    value1, value2 = 4

const
  Lookuptable = [
    E1.value1: "1",
    value2: "2"
  ]
```

The types `E1` and `E2` share the names `value1` and `value2`. These are overloaded and the usual overload disambiguation
is used so that the `E1` or `E2` prefixes can be left out in many cases. These features are most beneficial for independently developed libraries.



## Strict funcs

The definition of "strict funcs" changed and is now considered to be stable enough to become the default in
later versions.



## Default values for objects

Inside an object declaration, fields can now have default values:

```nim
type
  Rational* = object
    num: int = 0
    den: int = 1

var r = Rational()
assert $r == "(num: 0, den: 1)"
```

These default values are used when the field is not initialized explicitly. See also [default values for object fields](https://nim-lang.github.io/Nim/manual.html#types-default-values-for-object-fields) for details.




## Definite assignment analysis

We found Nim's default initialization rule to be one major source of bugs. There is a new
experimental switch called `strictDefs` that protects against these bugs. When enabled,
it is enforced that a variable has been given a value explicitly before the variable can
be used:

```nim
  {.experimental: "strictDefs".}

  proc main =
    var r: Rational
    echo r # Warning: use explicit initialization of 'r' for clarity [Uninit]

  main()
```

To turn the warning into an error, use `--warningAsError:Uninit:on` on the command line.


The analysis understands basic control flow so the following works because every
possible code path assigns a value to `r` before it is used:

```nim
{.experimental: "strictDefs".}

proc main(cond: bool) =
  var r: Rational
  if cond:
    r = Rational(num: 3, den: 3)
  else:
    r = Rational()
  echo r

main(false)
```

Even better, this feature works with `let` variables too:

```nim
{.experimental: "strictDefs".}

proc main(cond: bool) =
  let r: Rational
  if cond:
    r = Rational(num: 3, den: 3)
  else:
    r = Rational()
  echo r

main(false)
```

It is checked that every `let` variable is assigned a value exactly once.




## Out parameters

In order to make `experimental:strictDefs` more effective `out` parameters have been
added to Nim. For more information consult the manual about [experimental features](https://nim-lang.github.io/Nim/manual_experimental.html#strict-definitions-and-nimout-parameters-nimout-parameters).



## Strict effects

`--experimental:strictEffects` are now always enabled. Strict effects require callback
parameters to be annotated with `effectsOf`:

```nim
func sort*[T](a: var openArray[T],
              cmp: proc (x, y: T): int {.closure.},
              order = SortOrder.Ascending) {.effectsOf: cmp.}
```

The meaning here is that `sort` has the effects of `cmp`: `sort` can raise the exceptions of `cmp`.




## Forbid certain effects

Nim's effect tracking can now forbid certain effects while being oblivious to others:

```nim
type
  Effect1 = object

proc test(callback: proc(x: int) {.forbids: [Effect1].}) =
  callback(1)
```

In this example `test` takes a callback that can have any effect except `Effect1`. This mechanism can be used to enforce that a subsystem cannot accidentically call into a different subsystem. For example, in a game engine it could be used to ensure that the renderer logic does not call into a scripting layer.




## Unicode operators

`--experimental:unicodeOperators` are now always enabled: Unicode operators like
`⊗` or `∘` can be used by math libraries. Note that the standard library does not
use Unicode operators and will not for the foreseeable future.

# Footnotes

Tested on a 2.3 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9, 2019 macOS 11.5 with 64GB RAM.
* [1] command used: `nim c -d:danger`.
  The binary size can be further reduced to 49K with stripping (`--passL:-s`)
  and link-time optimization (`--passC:-flto`).
  Statically linking against `musl` brings it under 5K - see
  [here](https://github.com/ee7/binary-size) for more details.
* [2] commands used:
  - for Nim: `nim c --forceBuild compiler/nim`
  - for Rust: `./x.py build`, [details](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/76jq7h/long_time_to_compile_rustc/)
  - for GCC: see [1](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/421822/how-long-does-it-take-to-compile-gcc-7-3-0)
    [2](https://solarianprogrammer.com/2016/10/07/building-gcc-ubuntu-linux/)
  - for Clang: [details](https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/2018/04/16/building-llvm-from-source/)
  - for Go: `./make.bash`
* [3] a separate nimscript file can be used if needed to execute code at compile time
  before compiling the main program but it's in the same language
