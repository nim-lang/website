title: "Version 1.4.0 released"
author: The Nim Team
---

We are very proud to announce Nim version 1.4 after six months of continuous development!
Other than version 1.0, this is probably the biggest Nim release yet and we're very excited to release it!

It contains exactly 900 new commits which have not already been backported to our previous versions.
There are several new features and standard library additions compared to 1.2.
We tried to keep breaking changes to a minimum, but some bugfixes weren't possible
without making those necessary changes, and we feel that our users will benefit
from them.

We would recommend to all of our users to upgrade and use version 1.4.

This release also includes the latest version of Nim's package manager Nimble, v0.12.0,
the changelog for which is available [here](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble/blob/master/changelog.markdown#0120).



# Installing Nim 1.4

## New users

Check out if the package manager of your OS already ships version 1.4 or
install it as described [here](https://nim-lang.org/install.html).


## Existing users

If you have installed a previous version of Nim using `choosenim`,
getting Nim 1.4 is as easy as:

```bash
$ choosenim update self
$ choosenim update stable
```

If you don't have `choosenim`, you can follow the same
[install link](https://nim-lang.org/install.html) as above.



# Contributors to v1.4

Our contributors are amazing, and there are
[far too many](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/graphs/contributors?from=2020-04-03&to=2020-10-16&type=c)
to list here.
Big thanks to all of you, we couldn't have pulled off this release without you!



# New features

## GC: ORC

A new reference counting algorithm called ARC was first shipped with Nim 1.2.
If you haven't watched it already, we recommend
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUJcYTnPWCg) from [NimConf 2020](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxLdEZg8DRwTIEzUpfaIcBqhsj09mLWHx)
where Araq explains details behind ARC and shows some benchmarks that
illustrate the benefits.

As far as we know, ARC works with the complete standard library except for
the current implementation of `async`, because that introduces cycles that
ARC doesn't deal with.
There are other `async` implementations in development that don't introduce cycles.

ORC is the existing ARC algorithm plus a cycle collector, and `--gc:orc` is our
main new feature for this release!
We recommend reading
[this introductory ARC/ORC post](https://nim-lang.org/blog/2020/10/15/introduction-to-arc-orc-in-nim.html)
to get an idea about ARC/ORC's advantages.


### How to use ARC and ORC

If you haven't used ARC already with Nim 1.2, all you have to do is to pass `--gc:arc`
on the command line:
```nim
nim c -d:release --gc:arc myprogram.nim
```

For the majority of programs this is all it takes.

If your code uses cyclic data structures, or if you're not sure if your code
produces cycles, you need to use `--gc:orc` and not `--gc:arc`.

If you have an object that looks cyclic, but you *know* it isn't, you can help ORC by
marking it as `{.acyclic.}` in the following way:
```nim
type
  Node {.acyclic.} = ref object
    left, right: Node
    data: string
```

To read more about `{.acyclic.}` pragma, please
[check out the manual](https://nim-lang.github.io/Nim/manual.html#pragmas-acyclic-pragma).


### Known incompatibilities and gotchas

#### Deepcopy

If you use `system.deepCopy` in your code, you need to enable it via
`--deepCopy:on` on the command line.
This is a band-aid and a better solution for this will arrive in the future.

The reason for this opt-in switch is that ARC and ORC do not use the old runtime
type information (RTTI) that `system.deepCopy` is built upon.
We've built ARC and ORC with embedded devices in mind where the overhead of the
old RTTI has been reported to be unacceptable.


#### Order of declarations

The second gotcha people might encounter is the strict ordering requirement
for custom destructors; this affects old code as well, because finalizers are
mapped to destructors.
For example:

```nim
type
  CustomObject = ref object
    p: ptr int

proc tricky() =
  # would use the default destructor
  var x: CustomObject

proc finalizer(x: CustomObject) =
  if x.p != nil:
    dealloc(x.p)

proc newCustomObject(): CustomObject =
  new(result, finalizer)
```

This produces the following error message:
```
temp.nim(15, 6) Error: cannot bind another '=destroy' to: CustomObject:ObjectType;
previous declaration was constructed here implicitly: temp.nim(8, 7)
```

The reason is that only after the `new(result, finalizer)` call the compiler knows
that it needs to generate a custom destructor for the `CustomObject` type,
but when it compiled `tricky` the default destructor was used.

The solution is to move the proc `tricky` after the `newCustomObject` declaration:
```nim
type
  CustomObject = ref object
    p: ptr int

proc finalizer(x: CustomObject) =
  if x.p != nil:
    dealloc(x.p)

proc newCustomObject(): CustomObject =
  new(result, finalizer)

proc tricky() =
  # uses the custom destructor
  var x: CustomObject
```

This is a current limitation that will be improved in future versions of the compiler.



## Strict(er) functions

This is an experimental feature available via `{.experimental: "strictFuncs".}` pragma in
your code or via the `--experimental:strictFuncs` switch.

It introduces a stricter definition of a "side effect":
If an object is reachable via a parameter that is not declared as a `var` parameter,
any mutation to that object counts as a side effect.

Here is an example from
[the experimental manual](https://nim-lang.github.io/Nim/manual_experimental.html#strict-funcs):

```nim
{.experimental: "strictFuncs".}

type
  Node = ref object
    le, ri: Node
    data: string

func len(n: Node): int =
  # valid: len does not have side effects
  var it = n
  while it != nil:
    inc result
    it = it.ri

func mut(n: Node) =
  let m = n # is the statement that connected the mutation to the parameter
  m.data = "yeah" # the mutation is here
  # Error: 'mut' can have side effects
  # an object reachable from 'n' is potentially mutated
```

For more details, please see [Araq's blog post](https://nim-lang.org/blog/2020/09/01/write-tracking.html).


# Changelog

## Standard library additions and changes

- Added some enhancements to `std/jsonutils` module.
  * Added a possibility to deserialize JSON arrays directly to `HashSet` and
    `OrderedSet` types and respectively to serialize those types to JSON arrays
    via `jsonutils.fromJson` and `jsonutils.toJson` procedures.
  * Added a possibility to deserialize JSON `null` objects to Nim option objects
    and respectively to serialize Nim option object to JSON object if `isSome`
    or to JSON null object if `isNone` via `jsonutils.fromJson` and
    `jsonutils.toJson` procedures.
  * Added a `Joptions` parameter to `jsonutils.fromJson` currently
    containing two boolean options `allowExtraKeys` and `allowMissingKeys`.
    - If `allowExtraKeys` is `true` Nim's object to which the JSON is parsed is
      not required to have a field for every JSON key.
    - If `allowMissingKeys` is `true` Nim's object to which JSON is parsed is
      allowed to have fields without corresponding JSON keys.

- Added `bindParams`, `bindParam` to `db_sqlite` for binding parameters into a `SqlPrepared` statement.

- Added `tryInsert`,`insert` procs to `db_*` libs which accept primary key column name.

- Added `xmltree.newVerbatimText` support create `style`'s,`script`'s text.

- `uri` module now implements RFC-2397.

- Added [DOM Parser](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMParser)
  to the `dom` module for the JavaScript target.

- The default hash for `Ordinal` has changed to something more bit-scrambling.
  `import hashes; proc hash(x: myInt): Hash = hashIdentity(x)` recovers the old
  one in an instantiation context while `-d:nimIntHash1` recovers it globally.

- `deques.peekFirst` and `deques.peekLast` now have `var Deque[T] -> var T` overloads.

- File handles created from high-level abstractions in the stdlib will no longer
  be inherited by child processes. In particular, these modules are affected:
  `asyncdispatch`, `asyncnet`, `system`, `nativesockets`, `net` and `selectors`.

  For `asyncdispatch`, `asyncnet`, `net` and `nativesockets`, an `inheritable`
  flag has been added to all `proc`s that create sockets, allowing the user to
  control whether the resulting socket is inheritable. This flag is provided to
  ease the writing of multi-process servers, where sockets inheritance is
  desired.

  For a transition period, define `nimInheritHandles` to enable file handle
  inheritance by default. This flag does **not** affect the `selectors` module
  due to the differing semantics between operating systems.

  `asyncdispatch.setInheritable`, `system.setInheritable` and
  `nativesockets.setInheritable` are also introduced for setting file handle or
  socket inheritance. Not all platforms have these `proc`s defined.

- The file descriptors created for internal bookkeeping by `ioselector_kqueue`
  and `ioselector_epoll` will no longer be leaked to child processes.

- `strutils.formatFloat` with `precision = 0` has been restored to the version
  1 behaviour that produces a trailing dot, e.g. `formatFloat(3.14159, precision = 0)`
  is now `3.`, not `3`.
- Added `commonPrefixLen` to `critbits`.

- `relativePath(rel, abs)` and `relativePath(abs, rel)` used to silently give wrong results
  (see #13222); instead they now use `getCurrentDir` to resolve those cases,
  and this can now throw in edge cases where `getCurrentDir` throws.
  `relativePath` also now works for js with `-d:nodejs`.

- JavaScript and NimScript standard library changes: `streams.StringStream` is
  now supported in JavaScript, with the limitation that any buffer `pointer`s
  used must be castable to `ptr string`, any incompatible pointer type will not
  work. The `lexbase` and `streams` modules used to fail to compile on
  NimScript due to a bug, but this has been fixed.

  The following modules now compile on both JS and NimScript: `parsecsv`,
  `parsecfg`, `parsesql`, `xmlparser`, `htmlparser` and `ropes`. Additionally
  supported for JS is `cstrutils.startsWith` and `cstrutils.endsWith`, for
  NimScript: `json`, `parsejson`, `strtabs` and `unidecode`.

- Added `streams.readStr` and `streams.peekStr` overloads to
  accept an existing string to modify, which avoids memory
  allocations, similar to `streams.readLine` (#13857).

- Added high-level `asyncnet.sendTo` and `asyncnet.recvFrom` UDP functionality.

- `dollars.$` now works for unsigned ints with `nim js`.

- Improvements to the `bitops` module, including bitslices, non-mutating versions
  of the original masking functions, `mask`/`masked`, and varargs support for
  `bitand`, `bitor`, and `bitxor`.

- `sugar.=>` and `sugar.->` changes: Previously `(x, y: int)` was transformed
  into `(x: auto, y: int)`, it now becomes `(x: int, y: int)` for consistency
  with regular proc definitions (although you cannot use semicolons).

  Pragmas and using a name are now allowed on the lefthand side of `=>`. Here
  is an example of these changes:
  ```nim
  import sugar

  foo(x, y: int) {.noSideEffect.} => x + y

  # is transformed into

  proc foo(x: int, y: int): auto {.noSideEffect.} = x + y
  ```

- The fields of `times.DateTime` are now private, and are accessed with getters and deprecated setters.

- The `times` module now handles the default value for `DateTime` more consistently.
  Most procs raise an assertion error when given
  an uninitialized `DateTime`, the exceptions are `==` and `$` (which returns `"Uninitialized DateTime"`).
  The proc `times.isInitialized` has been added which can be used to check if
  a `DateTime` has been initialized.

- Fix a bug where calling `close` on io streams in `osproc.startProcess` was a noop and led to
  hangs if a process had both reads from stdin and writes (e.g. to stdout).

- The callback that is passed to `system.onThreadDestruction` must now be `.raises: []`.

- The callback that is assigned to `system.onUnhandledException` must now be `.gcsafe`.

- `osproc.execCmdEx` now takes an optional `input` for stdin, `workingDir` and `env`
  parameters.

- Added a `ssl_config` module containing lists of secure ciphers as recommended by
  [Mozilla OpSec](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS)

- `net.newContext` now defaults to the list of ciphers targeting
  ["Intermediate compatibility"](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Intermediate_compatibility_.28recommended.29)
  per Mozilla's recommendation instead of `ALL`. This change should protect
  users from the use of weak and insecure ciphers while still provides
  adequate compatibility with the majority of the Internet.

- A new module `std/jsonutils` with hookable `jsonTo,toJson,fromJson` operations for json
  serialization/deserialization of custom types was added.

- A new proc `heapqueue.find[T](heap: HeapQueue[T], x: T): int` to get index of element ``x``
  was added.

- Added `rstgen.rstToLatex` a convenience proc for `renderRstToOut` and `initRstGenerator`.

- Added `os.normalizeExe`.

- `macros.newLit` now preserves named vs unnamed tuples.

- Added `random.gauss`, that uses the ratio of uniforms method of sampling from a Gaussian distribution.

- Added `typetraits.elementType` to get the element type of an iterable.

- `typetraits.$` changes: `$(int,)` is now `"(int,)"` instead of `"(int)"`;
  `$tuple[]` is now `"tuple[]"` instead of `"tuple"`;
  `$((int, float), int)` is now `"((int, float), int)"` instead of `"(tuple of (int, float), int)"`

- Added `macros.extractDocCommentsAndRunnables` helper.

- `strformat.fmt` and `strformat.&` support `specifier =`. `fmt"{expr=}"` now
  expands to `fmt"expr={expr}"`.

- Deprecations: instead of `os.existsDir` use `dirExists`, instead of `os.existsFile` use `fileExists`.

- Added the `jsre` module, [Regular Expressions for the JavaScript target.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions).

- Made `maxLines` argument `Positive` in `logging.newRollingFileLogger`,
  because negative values will result in a new file being created for each logged
  line which doesn't make sense.

- Changed `log` in `logging` to use proper log level for JavaScript,
  e.g. `debug` uses `console.debug`, `info` uses `console.info`, `warn` uses `console.warn`, etc.

- Tables, HashSets, SharedTables and deques don't require anymore that the passed
  initial size must be a power of two - this is done internally.
  Proc `rightSize` for Tables and HashSets is deprecated, as it is not needed anymore.
  `CountTable.inc` takes `val: int` again not `val: Positive`; i.e. it can "count down" again.

- Removed deprecated symbols from `macros` module, some of which were deprecated already in `0.15`.

- Removed `sugar.distinctBase`, deprecated since `0.19`. Use `typetraits.distinctBase`.

- `asyncdispatch.PDispatcher.handles` is exported so that an external low-level libraries can access it.

- `std/with`, `sugar.dup` now support object field assignment expressions:
  ```nim
  import std/with

  type Foo = object
    x, y: int

  var foo = Foo()
  with foo:
    x = 10
    y = 20

  echo foo
  ```

- Proc `math.round` is no longer deprecated. The advice to use `strformat` instead
  cannot be applied to every use case. The limitations and the (lack of) reliability
  of `round` are well documented.

- Added `getprotobyname` to `winlean`. Added `getProtoByname` to `nativesockets` which returns a protocol code
  from the database that matches the protocol `name`.

- Added missing attributes and methods to `dom.Navigator` like `deviceMemory`, `onLine`, `vibrate()`, etc.

- Added `strutils.indentation` and `strutils.dedent` which enable indented string literals:
  ```nim
  import strutils
  echo dedent """
    This
      is
        cool!
    """
  ```

- Added `initUri(isIpv6: bool)` to `uri` module, now `uri` supports parsing ipv6 hostname.

- Added `readLines(p: Process)` to `osproc`.

- Added the below `toX` procs for collections. The usage is similar to procs such as
  `sets.toHashSet` and `tables.toTable`. Previously, it was necessary to create the
  respective empty collection and add items manually.
    * `critbits.toCritBitTree`, which creates a `CritBitTree` from an `openArray` of
       items or an `openArray` of pairs.
    * `deques.toDeque`, which creates a `Deque` from an `openArray`.
    * `heapqueue.toHeapQueue`, which creates a `HeapQueue` from an `openArray`.
    * `intsets.toIntSet`, which creates an `IntSet` from an `openArray`.

- Added `progressInterval` argument to `asyncftpclient.newAsyncFtpClient` to control the interval
  at which progress callbacks are called.

- Added `os.copyFileToDir`.

## Language changes

- The `=destroy` hook no longer has to reset its target, as the compiler now automatically inserts
  `wasMoved` calls where needed.
- The `=` hook is now called `=copy` for clarity. The old name `=` is still available so there
  is no need to update your code. This change was backported to 1.2 too so you can use the
  more readable `=copy` without loss of compatibility.

- In the newruntime it is now allowed to assign to the discriminator field
  without restrictions as long as the case object doesn't have a custom destructor.
  The discriminator value doesn't have to be a constant either. If you have a
  custom destructor for a case object and you do want to freely assign discriminator
  fields, it is recommended to refactor the object into 2 objects like this:

  ```nim
  type
    MyObj = object
      case kind: bool
      of true: y: ptr UncheckedArray[float]
      of false: z: seq[int]

  proc `=destroy`(x: MyObj) =
    if x.kind and x.y != nil:
      deallocShared(x.y)
  ```
  Refactor into:
  ```nim
  type
    MySubObj = object
      val: ptr UncheckedArray[float]
    MyObj = object
      case kind: bool
      of true: y: MySubObj
      of false: z: seq[int]

  proc `=destroy`(x: MySubObj) =
    if x.val != nil:
      deallocShared(x.val)
  ```
- `getImpl` on enum type symbols now returns field syms instead of idents. This helps
  with writing typed macros. The old behavior for backwards compatibility can be restored
  with `--useVersion:1.0`.

- The typed AST for proc headers will now have the arguments be syms instead of idents.
  This helps with writing typed macros. The old behaviour for backwards compatibility can
  be restored with `--useVersion:1.0`.

- ``let`` statements can now be used without a value if declared with
  ``importc``/``importcpp``/``importjs``/``importobjc``.

- The keyword `from` is now usable as an operator.

- Exceptions inheriting from `system.Defect` are no longer tracked with
  the `.raises: []` exception tracking mechanism. This is more consistent with the
  built-in operations. The following always used to compile (and still does):
  ```nim
  proc mydiv(a, b): int {.raises: [].} =
    a div b # can raise an DivByZeroDefect
  ```

  Now also this compiles:
  ```nim
  proc mydiv(a, b): int {.raises: [].} =
    if b == 0: raise newException(DivByZeroDefect, "division by zero")
    else: result = a div b
  ```

  The reason for this is that `DivByZeroDefect` inherits from `Defect` and
  with `--panics:on` `Defects` become unrecoverable errors.

- Added the `thiscall` calling convention as specified by Microsoft, mostly for hooking purposes.

- Deprecated the `{.unroll.}` pragma, because it was always ignored by the compiler anyway.

- Removed the deprecated `strutils.isNilOrWhitespace`.

- Removed the deprecated `sharedtables.initSharedTable`.

- Removed the deprecated `asyncdispatch.newAsyncNativeSocket`.

- Removed the deprecated `dom.releaseEvents` and `dom.captureEvents`.

- Removed `sharedlists.initSharedList`, was deprecated and produces undefined behaviour.

- There is a new experimental feature called "strictFuncs" which makes the definition of
  `.noSideEffect` stricter. [See here](https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual_experimental.html#strict-funcs)
  for more information.

- "for-loop macros" (see [the manual](https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#macros-for-loop-macro)) are no longer
  an experimental feature. In other words, you don't have to write pragma
  `{.experimental: "forLoopMacros".}` if you want to use them.

- Added the ``.noalias`` pragma. It is mapped to C's ``restrict`` keyword for the increased
  performance this keyword can enable.

- `items` no longer compiles with enums with holes as its behavior was error prone, see #14004.

- `system.deepcopy` has to be enabled explicitly for `--gc:arc` and `--gc:orc` via
  `--deepcopy:on`.

- Added the `std/effecttraits` module for introspection of the inferred effects.
  We hope this enables `async` macros that are precise about the possible exceptions that
  can be raised.

- The pragma blocks `{.gcsafe.}: ...` and `{.noSideEffect.}: ...` can now also be
  written as `{.cast(gcsafe).}: ...` and `{.cast(noSideEffect).}: ...`. This is the new
  preferred way of writing these, emphasizing their unsafe nature.


## Compiler changes

- Specific warnings can now be turned into errors via `--warningAsError[X]:on|off`.

- The `define` and `undef` pragmas have been de-deprecated.

- New command: `nim r main.nim [args...]` which compiles and runs main.nim, and implies `--usenimcache`
  so that the output is saved to $nimcache/main$exeExt, using the same logic as `nim c -r` to
  avoid recompilations when sources don't change.
  Example:
  ```bash
  nim r compiler/nim.nim --help # only compiled the first time
  echo 'import os; echo getCurrentCompilerExe()' | nim r - # this works too
  nim r compiler/nim.nim --fullhelp # no recompilation
  nim r --nimcache:/tmp main # binary saved to /tmp/main
  ```

- `--hint:processing` is now supported and means `--hint:processing:on`
  (likewise with other hints and warnings), which is consistent with all other bool flags.
  (since 1.3.3).

- `nim doc -r main` and `nim rst2html -r main` now call `openDefaultBrowser`.

- Added the new hint `--hint:msgOrigin` will show where a compiler msg (hint|warning|error)
  was generated; this helps in particular when it's non obvious where it came from
  either because multiple locations generate the same message, or because the
  message involves runtime formatting.

- Added the new flag `--backend:js|c|cpp|objc` (or -b:js etc), to change the backend; can be
  used with any command (e.g. nim r, doc, check etc); safe to re-assign.

- Added the new flag `--doccmd:cmd` to pass additional flags for runnableExamples,
  e.g.: `--doccmd:-d:foo --threads`
  use `--doccmd:skip` to skip runnableExamples and rst test snippets.

- Added the new flag `--usenimcache` to output binary files to nimcache.

- `runnableExamples "-b:cpp -r:off": code` is now supported, allowing to override
  how an example is compiled and run, for example to change the backend.

- `nim doc` now outputs under `$projectPath/htmldocs` when `--outdir` is unspecified
  (with or without `--project`); passing `--project` now automatically generates
  an index and enables search.
  See [docgen](https://nim-lang.org/docs/docgen.html) for details.

- Removed the `--oldNewlines` switch.

- Removed the `--laxStrings` switch for mutating the internal zero terminator on strings.

- Removed the `--oldast` switch.

- Removed the `--oldgensym` switch.

- `$getType(untyped)` is now "untyped" instead of "expr", `$getType(typed)` is
  now "typed" instead of "stmt".

- Sink inference is now disabled per default and has to enabled explicitly via
  `--sinkInference:on`. *Note*: For the standard library sink inference remains
  enabled. This change is most relevant for the `--gc:arc`, `--gc:orc` memory
  management modes.


## Tool changes

- `nimsuggest` now returns both the forward declaration and the
  implementation location upon a `def` query. Previously the behavior was
  to return the forward declaration only.
