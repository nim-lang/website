title: "Version 1.2.0 released"
author: The Nim Team
---

We are very proud to announce Nim version 1.2 after six months of the continuous development!

This release contains around 600 new commits since the release of 1.0 which were
not already backported to our 1.0.x versions.
There are several new features and standard library additions compared to 1.0.
We tried to keep breaking changes to a minimum, but some bugfixes weren't possible
without making those necessary changes, and we feel that our users will benefit
from those changes.

We would recommend to all of our users to upgrade and use version 1.2.


## Using multiple Nim versions

### `useVersion`

If you would like to upgrade to version v1.2, but you are relying on a v1.0 behaviour,
there is a command line switch `--useVersion`, which you can use with the newest
Nim to simulate previous versions.

For example, Nim v1.2 is more strict about type conversions concerning proc
types.
If this breaks your code, pass `--useVersion:1.0`, which will emulate the old
behaviour.

This is not limited to the above example.
If you were relying on some edge case and/or buggy behaviour which is now fixed,
try if `--useVersion:1.0` gives you back the results you expect to see.
If that doesn't work and you need the old behaviour, please open an issue in
[our bug tracker](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/issues) and we will try to
make it work in future bugfix releases (1.2.x).


### `when declared`

If you are library author and you would like your library to be available both
for v1.0 and v1.2 users, but you are relying on some new features introduced in
v1.2 which are not available in v1.0 release, you can use `when declared` to
your advantage.

For example, `sequtils` module now has `unzip` proc.
You can write your code like this:

```nim
import sequtils

when not declared(unzip):
  proc unzip*[S, T](s: openArray[(S, T)]): (seq[S], seq[T]) =
    result[0] = newSeq[S](s.len)
    result[1] = newSeq[T](s.len)
    for i in 0..<s.len:
      result[0][i] = s[i][0]
      result[1][i] = s[i][1]

let a = @[('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]
let b = unzip(a) # version 1.0 will use the proc declared above
                 # version 1.2 will use sequtils' proc

assert b == (@['a', 'b', 'c'], @[1, 2, 3])
```


# Installing Nim 1.2


## New users

Check out if the package manager of your OS already ships version 1.2 or
install it as described [here](https://nim-lang.org/install.html).


## Existing users

If you have installed a previous version of Nim using `choosenim`,
getting Nim 1.2 is as easy as:

```bash
$ choosenim update stable
```


# Contributors to v1.2

Our contributors are amazing, and there is
[far too many](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/graphs/contributors?from=2019-09-23&to=2020-03-20&type=c)
to list here.
Big thanks to all of you, we couldn't have pulled off this release without you!



# New features

## GC: ARC

`--gc:arc` is our main new feature for this release!

Instead of going into a lots of details and hijacking this release article,
we would like to point you to
[this video from FOSDEM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yA32Wxl59wo)
where Araq explains details behind ARC and shows some benchmarks which show
the benefits of it.

A more detailed article about ARC might follow in the future.



## New sugar macros

Version 1.2.0 introduces several new macros which should help with writing
some common tasks.

In the next few sections we will show them and their usages.
All the examples imply `import sugar`.


### Collect

`collect` is a macro which helps with writing seq/set/table comprehensions.
It replaces the `lc` (list comprehension), and it is both more idiomatic and
more powerful than `lc`.
There is no overhead for using `collect`, e.g. you can use `newSeqOfCap` with it.

The syntax for all collections is similar, with the difference being the
`init` function and the last expression.

Examples:

```nim
let numbers = collect(newSeq):  # or: collect(newSeqOfCap(10))
  for i in 1..10:
    i

assert numbers == @[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]


import tables
let oddSquares = collect(initTable):
  for i in numbers:
    if i mod 2 == 1:
      {i: i * i}

assert len(oddSquares) == 5
assert oddSquares[7] == 49


import sets
let oddOrNegative = collect(initHashSet):
  for i in numbers:
    {if i mod 2 == 1: i else: -i}

assert 5 in oddOrNegative
assert 2 notin oddOrNegative
assert -2 in oddOrNegative
```


### Dup

`dup` is a macro which turns an in-place function into one that returns a
result without modifying its input.
The idea is that future versions of Nim will offer only in-place versions
of the functions (i.e. no more `sort` and `sorted`, `rotateLeft` and
`rotatedLeft`, and so on), which could be transformed to functions returning
a copy via `dup`.

This macro also allows for (otherwise in-place) function chaining.


Examples:

```nim
proc makePalindrome(s: var string) =
  for i in countdown(s.len-2, 0):
    s.add(s[i])

var a = "abc"
makePalindrome(a)
assert a == "abcba"

var b = "xyz"
var c = b.dup(makePalindrome)

assert b == "xyz"
assert c == "xyzyx"
```

An underscore (`_`) can be used to denote the place of the argument you're
passing:

```nim
import algorithm

# b = "xyz"
var d = dup b:
  makePalindrome  # xyzyx
  sort(_, SortOrder.Descending)  # zyyxx
  makePalindrome  # zyyxxxyyz

assert d == "zyyxxxyyz"
```


### Capture

`capture` is a macro which is useful when creating a closure in a loop to capture
some local loop variables by their current iteration values.
You might want to use it for example for event handling and `{int: callBack}`
lookup tables.


Example:

```nim
import strformat, sugar

var myClosure: proc(): string

for i in 5..7:
  for j in 7..9:
    if i * j == 42:
      capture i, j:
        myClosure = proc (): string = fmt"{i} * {j} = 42"

let a = myClosure()
assert a == "6 * 7 = 42"
```




# Changelog


## Standard library additions and changes

- Added overloaded `strformat.fmt` macro that use specified characters as
  delimiter instead of '{' and '}'.
- Added new procs in `tables.nim`: `OrderedTable.pop`, `CountTable.del`,
  `CountTable.pop`, `Table.pop`.
- Added `strtabs.clear` overload that reuses the existing mode.
- Added `browsers.osOpen` const alias for the operating system specific *"open"* command.
- Added `sugar.dup` for turning in-place algorithms like `sort` and `shuffle`
  into operations that work on a copy of the data and return the mutated copy,
  like the existing `sorted` does.
- Added `sugar.collect` that does comprehension for seq/set/table collections.
- Added `sugar.capture` for capturing some local loop variables when creating a
  closure. This is an enhanced version of `closureScope`.
- Added `typetraits.tupleLen` to get number of elements of a tuple/type tuple,
  and `typetraits.get` to get the ith element of a type tuple.
- Added `typetraits.genericParams` to return a tuple of generic params from a
  generic instantiation.
- `options` now treats `proc` like other pointer types, meaning `nil` proc variables
  are converted to `None`.
- Added `os.normalizePathEnd` for additional path sanitization.
- Added `times.fromUnixFloat,toUnixFloat`, sub-second resolution versions of
  `fromUnix`,`toUnixFloat`.
- Added `wrapnils` module for chains of field-access and indexing where the LHS
  can be nil. This simplifies code by reducing need for if-else branches around
  intermediate maybe nil values. E.g. `echo ?.n.typ.kind`.
- Added `minIndex`, `maxIndex` and `unzip` to the `sequtils` module.
- Added `os.isRelativeTo` to tell whether a path is relative to another.
- Added `resetOutputFormatters` to `unittest`.
- Added `expectIdent` to the `macros` module.
- Added `os.isValidFilename` that returns `true` if `filename` argument is valid
  for cross-platform use.
- Added `times.isLeapDay`
- `base64` adds URL-Safe Base64, implements RFC-4648 Section-7.
- Added a new module, `std / compilesettings` for querying the compiler about
  diverse configuration settings.
- Added `net.getPeerCertificates` and `asyncnet.getPeerCertificates` for
  retrieving the verified certificate chain of the peer we are connected to
  through an SSL-wrapped `Socket`/`AsyncSocket`.
- Added `browsers.openDefaultBrowser` without URL, implements IETF RFC-6694 Section-3.
- Added `jsconsole.trace`, `jsconsole.table`, `jsconsole.exception` for JavaScript target.
- Added `distinctBase` overload for values: `assert 12.MyInt.distinctBase == 12`
- Added new module `std/stackframes`, in particular `setFrameMsg`, which enables
  custom runtime annotation of stackframes, see #13351 for examples.
  Turn on/off via `--stackTraceMsgs:on/off`.
- Added `sequtils.countIt`, allowing for counting items using a predicate.
- Added a `with` macro for easy function chaining that's available everywhere,
  there is no need to concern your APIs with returning the first argument
  to enable "chaining", instead use the dedicated macro `with` that
  was designed for it. For example:

```nim
type
  Foo = object
    col, pos: string

proc setColor(f: var Foo; r, g, b: int) = f.col = $(r, g, b)
proc setPosition(f: var Foo; x, y: float) = f.pos = $(x, y)

var f: Foo
with(f, setColor(2, 3, 4), setPosition(0.0, 1.0))
echo f
```

- `macros.newLit` now works for ref object types.
- `macro pragmas` can now be used in type sections.
- 5 new pragmas were added to Nim in order to make the upcoming tooling more
  convenient to use. Nim compiler checks these pragmas for syntax but otherwise
  ignores them. The pragmas are `requires`, `ensures`, `assume`, `assert`, `invariant`.
- `system.writeFile` has been overloaded to also support `openarray[byte]`.
- `asyncdispatch.drain` now properly takes into account `selector.hasPendingOperations`
  and only returns once all pending async operations are guaranteed to have completed.
- `sequtils.zip` now returns a sequence of anonymous tuples i.e. those tuples
  now do not have fields named "a" and "b".
- `distinctBase` has been moved from `sugar` to `typetraits` and now it is
  implemented as compiler type trait instead of macro. `distinctBase` in sugar
  module is now deprecated.
- `CountTable.mget` has been removed from `tables.nim`. It didn't work, and it
  was an oversight to be included in v1.0.
- `tables.merge(CountTable, CountTable): CountTable` has been removed.
  It didn't work well together with the existing inplace version of the same proc
  (`tables.merge(var CountTable, CountTable)`).
  It was an oversight to be included in v1.0.
- `asyncdispatch.drain` now consistently uses the passed timeout value for all
  iterations of the event loop, and not just the first iteration.
  This is more consistent with the other asyncdispatch APIs, and allows
  `asyncdispatch.drain` to be more efficient.
- `base64.encode` and `base64.decode` were made faster by about 50%.
- `htmlgen` adds [MathML](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/MathML) support
  (ISO 40314).
- `macros.eqIdent` is now invariant to export markers and backtick quotes.
- `htmlgen.html` allows `lang` in the `<html>` tag and common valid attributes.
- `macros.basename` and `basename=` got support for `PragmaExpr`,
  so that an expression like `MyEnum {.pure.}` is handled correctly.
- `httpclient.maxredirects` changed from `int` to `Natural`, because negative values
  serve no purpose whatsoever.
- `httpclient.newHttpClient` and `httpclient.newAsyncHttpClient` added `headers`
  argument to set initial HTTP Headers, instead of a hardcoded empty `newHttpHeader()`.
- `parseutils.parseUntil` has now a different behaviour if the `until` parameter is
  empty. This was required for intuitive behaviour of the strscans module
  (see bug #13605).
- `strutils.formatFloat` with `precision = 0` has the same behavior in all
  backends, and it is compatible with Python's behavior,
  e.g. `formatFloat(3.14159, precision = 0)` is now `3`, not `3.`.
- `times.parse` now only uses input to compute its result, and not `now`:
  `parse("2020", "YYYY", utc())` is now `2020-01-01T00:00:00Z` instead of
  `2020-03-02T00:00:00Z` if run on 03-02; it also doesn't crash anymore when
  used on 29th, 30th, 31st of each month.
- `httpcore.==(string, HttpCode)` is now deprecated due to lack of practical
  usage. The `$` operator can be used to obtain the string form of `HttpCode`
  for comparison if desired.
- `std/oswalkdir` was buggy, it's now deprecated and reuses `std/os` procs.
- `net.newContext` now performs SSL Certificate checking on Linux and OSX.
  Define `nimDisableCertificateValidation` to disable it globally.
- `os.walkDir` and `os.walkDirRec` now have new flag, `checkDir` (default: false).
  If it is set to true, it will throw if input dir is invalid instead of a noop
  (which is the default behaviour, as it was before this change),
  `os.walkDirRec` only throws if top-level dir is invalid, but ignores errors for
  subdirs, otherwise it would be impossible to resume iteration.
- The `FD` variant of `selector.unregister` for `ioselector_epoll` and
  `ioselector_select` now properly handle the `Event.User` select event type.
- `joinPath` path normalization when `/` is the first argument works correctly:
  `assert "/" / "/a" == "/a"`. Fixed the edge case: `assert "" / "" == ""`.
- `xmltree` now adds indentation consistently to child nodes for any number
  of children nodes.
- `os.splitPath()` behavior synchronized with `os.splitFile()` to return "/"
  as the dir component of `/root_sub_dir` instead of the empty string.
- The deprecated `lc` macro has been removed from `sugar`. It is now replaced with the
  more powerful `collect` macro.
- `os.relativePath("foo", "foo")` is now `"."`, not `""`, as `""` means invalid
  path and shouldn't be conflated with `"."`; use `-d:nimOldRelativePathBehavior`
  to restore the old behavior.
- `os.joinPath(a, b)` now honors trailing slashes in `b` (or `a` if `b` = "").
- `base64.encode` no longer supports `lineLen` and `newLine`.
  Use `base64.encodeMime` instead.


## Language changes

- An `align` pragma can now be used for variables and object fields, similar
  to the `alignas` declaration modifier in C/C++.
- `=sink` type bound operator is now optional. Compiler can now use combination
  of `=destroy` and `copyMem` to move objects efficiently.
- Unsigned integer operators have been fixed to allow promotion of the first operand.
- Conversions to unsigned integers are unchecked at runtime, imitating earlier Nim
  versions. The documentation was improved to acknowledge this special case.
  See https://github.com/nim-lang/RFCs/issues/175 for more details.
- New syntax for lvalue references: `var b {.byaddr.} = expr` enabled by
  `import std/decls`.
- `var a {.foo.}: MyType = expr` now lowers to `foo(a, MyType, expr)` for
  non-builtin pragmas, enabling things like lvalue references (see `decls.byaddr`).


## Compiler changes

- Generated JS code uses spaces, instead of mixed spaces and tabs.
- The Nim compiler now supports the ``--asm`` command option for easier
  inspection of the produced assembler code.
- The Nim compiler now supports a new pragma called ``.localPassc`` to
  pass specific compiler options to the C(++) backend for the C(++) file
  that was produced from the current Nim module.
- The compiler now inferes "sink parameters". To disable this for a specific routine,
  annotate it with `.nosinks`. To disable it for a section of code, use
  `{.push sinkInference: off.}`...`{.pop.}`.
- The compiler now supports a new switch `--panics:on` that turns runtime
  errors like `IndexError` or `OverflowError` into fatal errors that **cannot**
  be caught via Nim's `try` statement. `--panics:on` can improve the
  runtime efficiency and code size of your program significantly.
- The compiler now warns about inheriting directly from `system.Exception` as
  this is **very bad** style. You should inherit from `ValueError`, `IOError`,
  `OSError` or from a different specific exception type that inherits from
  `CatchableError` and cannot be confused with a `Defect`.
- The error reporting for Nim's effect system has been improved.
- Implicit conversions for `const` behave correctly now, meaning that code like
  `const SOMECONST = 0.int; procThatTakesInt32(SOMECONST)` will be illegal now.
  Simply write `const SOMECONST = 0` instead.
- The `{.dynlib.}` pragma is now required for exporting symbols when making
  shared objects on POSIX and macOS, which make it consistent with the behavior
  on Windows.
- The compiler is now more strict about type conversions concerning proc
  types: Type conversions cannot be used to hide `.raise` effects or side
  effects, instead a `cast` must be used. With the flag `--useVersion:1.0` the
  old behaviour is emulated.
- The Nim compiler now implements a faster way to detect overflows based
  on GCC's `__builtin_sadd_overflow` family of functions. (Clang also
  supports these). Some versions of GCC lack this feature and unfortunately
  we cannot detect this case reliably. So if you get compilation errors like
  "undefined reference to `__builtin_saddll_overflow`" compile your programs
  with `-d:nimEmulateOverflowChecks`.


## Tool changes

- Nimpretty doesn't accept negative indentation argument anymore, because it was
  breaking files.
