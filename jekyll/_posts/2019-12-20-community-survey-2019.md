We are proud to announce the launch of the official
[2019 Nim Community Survey](https://forms.gle/MM28istruU8YC7Fz9)!
No matter whether you use Nim today, have used Nim previously, or never used Nim before;
we want to know your opinions.
Your feedback will help the Nim project understand its strengths and
weaknesses, and to determine development priorities for the future.

It shouldn't take you much longer than 5 minutes to complete this survey.
Submissions will be accepted until around February 2020, depending on the
response rates.
If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate
to get in touch with us via email at survey@nim-lang.org or on the
[Nim Forum](http://forum.nim-lang.org).

This is now the fourth year in which this survey has been running.
