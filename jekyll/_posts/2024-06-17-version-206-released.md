title: "Nim version 2.0.6 released"
author: The Nim Team
---

The Nim team is happy to announce Nim version 2.0.6, our third, and the largest by far, patch release for Nim 2.0.

Version 2.0.6 contains (exactly!) [200 commits](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/compare/v2.0.4...v2.0.6) and brings bugfixes and improvements to Nim 2.0.4, released two months ago.

The reason for this many commits in this release is that this is planned as the last 2.0.x release before Nim 2.2 and we wanted to give you the best Nim 2.0 experience in case you won't be able to switch immediately to Nim 2.2.

**NOTE**: If your program uses threads (`--threads:on` became the default in the 2.0.x line) please also use the `-d:useMalloc` switch.
This problem will be fixed in a future release, sorry for the inconvenience.

Check out if the package manager of your OS already ships version 2.0.6 or
install it as described [here](https://nim-lang.org/install.html).


## Existing users

If you have installed a previous version of Nim using `choosenim`,
getting Nim 2.0.6 is as easy as:

```bash
$ choosenim 2.0.6
```

If you are on OSX ARM, `choosenim` will not work for you.
Please choose an alternative method of installing or updating.

Alternatively, you can download Nim 2.0.6 from
[our nightlies builds](https://github.com/nim-lang/nightlies/releases/tag/2024-06-17-version-2-0-c00e8e71e0c8465b5a5257c76c674b803273b222).
