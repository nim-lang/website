This Autumn you have the unique opportunity to take part in the first Nim event
held in Kyiv and to meet the creator of the Nim programming language -
Andreas Rumpf. The event is hosted by Zeo Alliance and is taking place between
14-15 November 2015 in Kyiv, Ukraine.

During the workshop you will learn:

- The basics of the language including its safe and unsafe subsets.
- How to use Nim to develop web applications.
- How Nim's meta programming capabilities make Nim the ultimate glue language,
  excellent at interoperability with C++, JavaScript, Java and others.
- Games in Nim and the ability to rapidly prototype without sacrificing speed.

Registration is free, but the number of places is limited. More details
can be found [here](https://nimworkshop.splashthat.com/).
