excerpt: "Here are the results of Nim Community Survey 2024."
---

The Nim community survey 2024 has been open for two months, and we have received 367 responses -- less than in previous years, but we'll still try to draw conclusions about our users and their habits.
Before we go into details, we would like to thank all the people who took the time to respond.
We really appreciate the feedback!

The goal of this survey was primarily to determine how our community is using Nim, in order to better understand how we should be improving it.



## Do you use Nim?

Based on the answer to this question, the respondents were divided into two groups that each received a separate set of questions.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/news/images/survey2024/01.png" alt="Do you use Nim?" style="width:100%"/>

Approximately three quarters of the respondents use Nim (40% frequently, 36% occasionally), while the remaining quarter is divided between people who never used Nim (7%) and people who stopped using Nim (17%).

Of those people who *don't* use Nim, the most frequent reasons are: "Nim seems immature, not ready for production", "Nim doesn't have libraries I need","Nim doesn't have enough learning materials", and "Nim seems too risky for production", in that order.



## Users

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/news/images/survey2024/02.png" alt="How long have you been using Nim?" style="width:100%"/>

Compared to the [response from last year]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/news/images/survey2023/02.png), our user-base has more Nim experience than before.
With 57% of users who are using Nim for at least two years and only 15% new users (using Nim less than a year), it seems that we're not attracting enough new users.


<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/news/images/survey2024/03.png" alt="Where are you from?" style="width:100%"/>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/news/images/survey2024/04.png" alt="What is your occupation?" style="width:100%"/>

A typical Nim user, just as in previous years, would be a software developer from Europe.

Besides Europe (more than half of our users), our users mostly come from North America and Asia.
We see a slight decline of software developers (41% vs 49% [last year]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/news/images/survey2023/04.png)), while there is an increase of freelancers and business owners.


<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/news/images/survey2024/05.png" alt="In what age group are you?" style="width:100%"/>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/news/images/survey2024/06.png" alt="How many years of programming experience do you have?" style="width:100%"/>

We have users from all age groups and all levels of programming experience, proving that Nim can be used both by beginners and veteran programmers.

Similar to [last year]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/news/images/survey2023/05.png), 33% Nim users are older than 40, 18% younger than 24.
The experience is also similar to [last year]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/news/images/survey2023/06.png): 55% users having at least 10 years of experience and just 6% users with less than 2 years of experience.


<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/news/images/survey2024/07.png" alt="What are the technical aspects or features of Nim you like the most?" style="width:100%"/>

Same as [previously]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/news/images/survey2023/07.png), things that people like about Nim the most are: performance/speed and syntax, syntax, ease of use, and self-contained binaries.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/news/images/survey2024/08.png" alt="What editor(s) do you use when writing Nim?" style="width:100%"/>

VS Code continues to dominate.
In the second place is Vim/Neovim, followed by Sublime Text, Emacs and IntelliJ.




## Nim versions

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/news/images/survey2024/09.png" alt="Which version(s) of Nim do you use?" style="width:100%"/>

We're glad to see that the large majority of users are using the latest stable version (2.2.x).

We can partially attribute this to the mostly painless upgrade process:

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/news/images/survey2024/10.png" alt="Has upgrading to a new version of the Nim compiler broken your code? How much work did it take to fix it?" style="width:100%"/>





## Using Nim

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/news/images/survey2024/11.png" alt="Roughly, what percentage of the programming work you do is in Nim?" style="width:100%"/>


The upward trend [started the last year]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/news/images/survey2023/11.png) is continuing -- more than 28% of our respondents use Nim for the majority of time (60% or more), which is a 40% increase from last year's 20% (and it was just 16% the year before).


<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/news/images/survey2024/14.png" alt="Do you use Nim at work?" style="width:100%"/>

Although the numbers are low, we are seeing an upward trend: slightly more users are using Nim at work than previously.


<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/news/images/survey2024/13.png" alt="What platforms are you targeting?" style="width:100%"/>

The change from [2023 responses]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/news/images/survey2023/13.png) is that embedded is now ahead of JavaScript.




## Learning Nim

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/news/images/survey2024/17.png" alt="If you started using Nim in last two years (2023 and 2024), what learning resources, if any, did you use to learn Nim?" style="width:100%"/>

This year we only wanted to see the responses of Nim-newcomers, to see what learning materials are still "fresh" and still used in 2024, but from the amount of responses we see that even some our more experienced users answered this question :)

The most popular learning resource are [the official tutorials](https://nim-lang.org/docs/tut1.html), followed by ["Nim by Example"](https://nim-by-example.github.io/getting_started/).
["Nim Basics"](https://narimiran.github.io/nim-basics/) is in the third place, surpassing ["Nim in Action"](https://book.picheta.me) and ["Mastering Nim"](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B4R7B9YX) books. 
[Rosetta Code examples](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Nim) is also a popular choice as a learning resource


<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/news/images/survey2024/18.png" alt="What kind of additional learning materials does Nim need?" style="width:100%"/>

Just like in [the previous survey]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/news/images/survey2023/18.png), the most wanted types of learning materials are code examples and written tutorials.

If someone in our community is willing to work on Nim, but has no idea *what* to do, these tutorials would be a good start.




## Nim in 2025 and beyond

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/news/images/survey2024/23.png" alt="What should be our priorities in improving Nim, that would bring the largest quality-of-life improvements? [improve tooling]" style="width:100%"/>

Each year improving the tooling is getting more and more votes, and this year it has become the top priority to fix, according to our users.

Thanks to our partnership with [Status](https://status.im), it is one of our main priorities for 2025.


<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/news/images/survey2024/21.png" alt="What should be our priorities in improving Nim, that would bring the largest quality-of-life improvements? [fixing compiler bugs]" style="width:100%"/>

Similar to the last year, 2/3 of our users find it very important to work on the compiler bugs.
We will continue to work on it, and we appreciate any community effort on this: we already have several individuals continuously helping us with fixing compiler bugs (thank you!), and we'd benefit from more.




<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/news/images/survey2024/20.png" alt="What should be our priorities in improving Nim, that would bring the largest quality-of-life improvements? [documentation]" style="width:100%"/>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/news/images/survey2024/26.png" alt="What should be our priorities in improving Nim, that would bring the largest quality-of-life improvements? [more learning materials (tutorials, videos, books, ...)]" style="width:100%"/>

These results are slightly better than last year ([documentation 2021]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/news/images/survey2023/20.png), [learning materials 2021]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/news/images/survey2023/26.png)).
When it comes to learning materials, where we mostly lean on the community content (for this to improve we need your involvement!), people want to see more written tutorials and code examples.
