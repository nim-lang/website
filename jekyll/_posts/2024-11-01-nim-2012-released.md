The Nim team is happy to announce Nim version 2.0.12, our sixth patch release for Nim 2.0,
for our users who haven't switched yet to [Nim 2.2](https://nim-lang.org/blog/2024/10/02/nim-220-2010.html).

Version 2.0.12 is a small release, containing just [24 commits](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/compare/v2.0.10...v2.0.12), but it brings several improvements to Nim 2.0.10, released a month ago.




## Installing Nim 2.0.12

If you have installed a previous version of Nim using `choosenim`,
getting Nim 2.0.12 is as easy as:

```bash
$ choosenim update self
$ choosenim 2.0.12
```

Make sure that the version of choosenim you have installed is 0.8.5 or higher, otherwise visit [choosenim's repo](https://github.com/nim-lang/choosenim) and see there how to re-install it first, before updating Nim.

Alternatively, you can download Nim 2.0.12 from
[our nightlies builds](https://github.com/nim-lang/nightlies/releases/tag/2024-11-01-version-2-0-ce7c6f4f3365db2cc63bdd9d460c71ed937ee9e9).
