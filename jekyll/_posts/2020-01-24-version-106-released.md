The Nim team is happy to announce version 1.0.6, our third patch release following
Nim 1.0.0.

To read more about version 1.0.0, take a look at our
[v1.0 release article](https://nim-lang.org/blog/2019/09/23/version-100-released.html).

This release comes two months after a previous release,
and it has almost [60 new commits](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/compare/v1.0.4...v1.0.6),
containing fixes for another 15 reported issues, several other bug fixes and documentation
improvements, making our 1.0 release even better.

There were no security-related problems, but we are trying to release 1.0.x versions
on a regular bi-monthly basis.
