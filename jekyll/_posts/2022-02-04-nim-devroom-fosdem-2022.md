## Nim Devroom at FOSDEM 2022 this Saturday 5th Feb

We are happy to announce that all preparations for the Nim Devroom at FOSDEM 2022 are now complete and
we are looking forward to 8 excellent talks with more than 5 hours of Nim-related content. The conference is online this year
and the talks will stream live tomorrow on the FOSDEM website. This is the final schedule for the Nim Devroom, which will be
held tomorrow (Saturday, February 5th) from 12:30 to 17:40: https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/track/nim_programming_language/

**Note that all times are Brussels' times (CET).**

FOSDEM is a two-day event organised by volunteers to promote the widespread use of free and open-source software.
It normally takes place in Brussels, but this year (like last year) it will be held remotely. Participation is open to anyone
and there is no need to register. This year is the first year that Nim has a dedicated devroom and we want to send special
thanks to our speakers for their contributions!

You will be able to interact with the speakers through a Matrix chat and at the end of every talk there will be a live Q&A with
the speaker. You may use a Matrix Client ([Element](https://element.io) is good choice that you can use both from web and as an
app) and use the link provided in the page of any talk, or you can access the chat at this link:
https://chat.fosdem.org/#/room/#nim-devroom:fosdem.org

Are you ready to:

* Hear the [past, present and future of concurrency](https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/nim_concurrency/)
  in Nim directly from the mouth of our BDFL
* Learn why Nim is well positioned for [Next generation micro-controller programming](https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/nim_ngmicrocontrollers/)
  thanks to the efforts of our own PMunch
* Discover that a Nim-based open-source library ([LibVF.io](https://github.com/Arc-Compute/libvf.io))
  is being used to [bring vGPU functionality to normal consumer GPUs](https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/nim_libvfio/)
* See how Nim can be used to create [Polymorph, a fast and frugal entity-component-system library](https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/nim_polymorph/)
* Help a 6-year-old build [Potato Zombies, a 3D game using Enu and Nim](https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/nim_potatozombies/)
* Have your mind blown by Zach showing off [Pararules, a Nim rules engine for reactive programs and games](https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/nim_pararules/)
* Join a data scientist working in genomics and follow him while he [boosts performance of his code switching from Python to Nim](https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/nim_hpcfrompythontonim/)
* And finally step through the power levels of [Nim metaprogramming in the real word](https://fosdem.org/2022/schedule/event/nim_metaprogramming/), thanks to Treeform!

We cannot wait to see you there!
