NimConf 2021 will take place in about two weeks from now -- on **June 26th**.

It will have the same format as in 2020, and it will be streamed for free via YouTube.

We cannot share the details yet, but you can expect **15+ talks** on various subjects
and we're sure you'll find something interesting for yourself.


## Participating as an audience

All talks will be streamed and recorded for later viewing.
Watching the talks live will allow you to ask questions and participate in the
discussions.

The timeline of talks will be published few days before the conference on our
[dedicated web page for NimConf 2021](https://conf.nim-lang.org/).
