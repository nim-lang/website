The Nim team is happy to announce Nim version 2.0.8, our fourth patch release for Nim 2.0.

Version 2.0.8 is a small release, containing just [20 commits](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/compare/v2.0.6...v2.0.8), but it brings important improvements to Nim 2.0.6, released 10 days ago.

Major improvements in this release:
- Nim's allocator is now much more stable with `--threads:on`.
- Better support for `gcc14`.
- Optimized `setLen(0)` for uninitialized strings and seqs.
- Optimized `move` when used with `--mm:refc`.

This release comes relatively quickly after our previous release because it was time-critical for our partner Status to receive these improvements as soon as possible.
It is our way of saying "thank you" for their continued support of Nim.


Check out if the package manager of your OS already ships version 2.0.8 or
install it as described [here](https://nim-lang.org/install.html).


## Existing users

If you have installed a previous version of Nim using `choosenim`,
getting Nim 2.0.8 is as easy as:

```bash
$ choosenim 2.0.8
```

If you are on OSX ARM, `choosenim` will not work for you.
Please choose an alternative method of installing or updating.

Alternatively, you can download Nim 2.0.8 from
