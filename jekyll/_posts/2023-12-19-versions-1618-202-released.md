title: "Versions 2.0.2 and 1.6.18 released"
author: The Nim Team
---

The Nim team is happy to announce two releases:
- the latest Nim, version 2.0.2
- LTS release, version 1.6.18


For the majority of our users, v2.0.2 contains [63 commits](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/compare/v2.0.0...v2.0.2) and brings bugfixes and improvements to Nim 2.0.0, released four months ago.

**NOTE**: If your program uses threads (`--threads:on` became the default in the 2.0.x line) please also use the `-d:useMalloc` switch.
This problem will be fixed in a future release, sorry for the inconvenience.


For those users who haven't switched to [Nim v2.0](https://nim-lang.org/blog/2023/08/01/nim-v20-released.html) yet, we have released the ninth patch release for Nim 1.6.x.
It is a small release with [13 commits](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/compare/v1.6.16...v1.6.18).



## Nim Community Survey 2023

Before going into details of the release, we would like to remind you that [2023 Nim Community Survey](https://nim-lang.org/blog/2023/11/17/community-survey-2023.html) is still open, and we would appreciate your input if you haven't done it already.




# Installing Nim 2.0.2

## New users

Check out if the package manager of your OS already ships version 2.0.2 or
install it as described [here](https://nim-lang.org/install.html).


## Existing users

If you have installed a previous version of Nim using `choosenim`,
getting Nim 2.0.2 is as easy as:

```bash
$ choosenim 2.0.2
```

If you are on OSX ARM, `choosenim` will not work for you.
Please choose an alternative method of installing or updating.

Alternatively, you can download Nim 2.0.2 from
[our nightlies builds](https://github.com/nim-lang/nightlies/releases/tag/2023-12-15-version-2-0-c4c44d10df8a14204a75c34e499def200589cb7c).
