title: "A New Home For Our Community"
author: Dominik Picheta
excerpt: "Take a look at some updates to our official IRC channel as well as new ways to connect to our community via Matrix."

The `#nim` channel on Freenode has been a home to our community for the better
part of a decade. While much of our community has moved to Discord since, aided
by a bridge which relays messages between IRC and Discord,
IRC is still an important part of our real-time chat community.

Unfortunately the multiple decisions
made by the new owners of Freenode (many of which you can read about
[here](https://gist.github.com/joepie91/df80d8d36cd9d1bde46ba018af497409)) have
made it untenable for our community to continue its life there.

Recently we have set up a new home for our IRC channels on Libera and intend
to continue to house part of our community there. Many of our core services
(like the public logs of our discussions, available at [https://irclogs.nim-lang.org/](https://irclogs.nim-lang.org/))
still rely on IRC and are likely to continue for the foreseeable future.

Our main IRC channel is still `#nim`, you can connect to it by following the
[Libera connection guide](https://libera.chat/guides/connect). It continues to
be bridged to [our Discord](https://discord.com/invite/nim) through a service that
we develop and [maintain](https://github.com/Yardanico/ircord/).
The equivalent `#nim` channel on Freenode is no longer our official IRC channel.

In addition to the Discord/IRC bridge that we run ourselves, we have also
set up third-party bridges as shown by the dashed line in the image above. This
means that you can now join the discussion no matter your preferred chat protocol,
with [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#nim:envs.net) and
[Telegram](https://t.me/nim_lang) both now being relayed to our Discord. Note however
that we are still testing the stability of these bridges and because they are
maintained by a third-party they may be less reliable.

In addition to our main channel (#main on Discord/#nim on Libera), we also now
have many Nim-related channels for specific topics, including:

* `#nim-gamedev`
* `#nim-webdev`
* `#nim-science`
* `#nim-embedded`
* `#nimble`
* `#nim-offtopic`

These channels are a place to discuss projects, get help with Nim and offer
a place to chat about any topic with the wider community. We encourage everyone
to join and participate in the discussions, we just ask you to remember to
[be kind](https://boz.com/articles/be-kind). Hope to see you there and thanks
for reading!
