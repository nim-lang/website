The Nim Team is happy to announce version 2.2.2, the first patch release for our stable release, Nim 2.2.

It comes four months after the 2.2.0 release and it contains [203 commits](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/compare/v2.2.0...v2.2.2), bringing bugfixes and improvements.

If you're still on Nim 1.6, take a look at the [version 2.0 release article](https://nim-lang.org/blog/2023/08/01/nim-v20-released.html) to see all the features you're missing.
If you've been using Nim 2.0, the [version 2.2 release article](https://nim-lang.org/blog/2024/10/02/nim-220-2010.html) shows the improvements available in Nim 2.2.





## Installing Nim 2.2.2


Check out if the package manager of your OS already ships version 2.2.2 or
install it as described [here](https://nim-lang.org/install.html).

If you have installed a previous version of Nim using `choosenim`,
getting Nim 2.2.2 is as easy as:

```bash
$ choosenim update self
$ choosenim update stable
```

**NOTE:** Make sure that the version of choosenim you have installed is 0.8.5 or higher, otherwise visit [choosenim's repo](https://github.com/nim-lang/choosenim) and see there how to re-install it first, before updating Nim.

Alternatively, you can download Nim 2.2.2 from
[our nightlies builds](https://github.com/nim-lang/nightlies/releases/tag/2025-02-06-version-2-2-6c34f62785263ad412f662f3e4e4bf8d8751d113).
