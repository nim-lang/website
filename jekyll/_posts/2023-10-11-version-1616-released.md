The Nim team is happy to announce version 1.6.16, our eight patch release for
Nim 1.6.

Version 1.6.16 is a result of three months of hard work, and it contains
[84 commits](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/compare/v1.6.14...v1.6.16),
bringing lots of general improvements over 1.6.14.

This release is aimed at our users who haven't switched to [Nim v2.0](https://nim-lang.org/blog/2023/08/01/nim-v20-released.html) yet.




# Installing Nim 1.6

## New users

Check out if the package manager of your OS already ships version 1.6.16 or
install it as described [here](https://nim-lang.org/install.html).


## Existing users

If you have installed a previous version of Nim using `choosenim`,
getting Nim 1.6.16 is as easy as:

```bash
$ choosenim 1.6.16
```

Alternatively, you can download Nim 1.6.16 from
[our nightlies builds](https://github.com/nim-lang/nightlies/releases/tag/2023-10-10-version-1-6-3c9b68dc157804885b14a1984efc25e8b7cc861d).
