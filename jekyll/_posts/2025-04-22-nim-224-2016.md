title: "Nim versions 2.2.4 and 2.0.16 released"
author: The Nim Team
---

The Nim Team is happy to announce two releases:
- version 2.2.4, a second patch release for the latest stable version
- version 2.0.16, an eight patch release for Nim 2.0



Nim v2.2.4 comes two and a half months after the v2.2.2 release and it contains [108 commits](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/compare/v2.2.2...v2.2.4) bringing bugfixes and improvements.

If you're still using Nim v2.0, the v2.0.16 release brings [31 commits](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/compare/v2.0.14...v2.0.16) with bugfixes.
But we would encourage you to switch to Nim v2.2, as it brings significant improvements to the ORC memory management and to the language and the compiler overall.  
Here is the [version 2.2 release article](https://nim-lang.org/blog/2024/10/02/nim-220-2010.html), showing the improvements available in Nim 2.2.

The Nim 2.2.4 changelog is available [here](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/blob/v2.2.4/changelog.md).





## Installing Nim 2.2.4


Check out if the package manager of your OS already ships version 2.2.4 or
install it as described [here](https://nim-lang.org/install.html).

If you have installed a previous version of Nim using `choosenim`,
getting Nim 2.2.4 is as easy as:

```bash
$ choosenim update self
$ choosenim update stable
```

**NOTE:** Make sure that the version of choosenim you have installed is 0.8.5 or higher, otherwise visit [choosenim's repo](https://github.com/nim-lang/choosenim) and see there how to re-install it first, before updating Nim.

Alternatively, you can download Nim 2.2.4 from
[our nightlies builds](https://github.com/nim-lang/nightlies/releases/tag/2025-04-22-version-2-2-f7145dd26efeeeb6eeae6fff649db244d81b212d).
