Earlier this year we have had the privilege of receiving 1.868BTC
(~117k USD at time of writing) to our long-standing Bitcoin wallet address.
We wanted to take this opportunity to give our thanks for this donation and many others
across our many [different fundraising efforts](https://nim-lang.org/donate.html).
But to also outline the steps we have taken to secure our funds and announce that
the old Bitcoin wallet address has now been deprecated.

*(The transaction of the donation in question, also viewable [here on blockchain explorer](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/ccaec6c8647a29f75674dcdc17fbcf03243389d55920ff21e40c593771c163dd).)*

The Bitcoin wallet that we have been using was created all the way back in 2011.
We've received some small donations here and there, in hindsight we should have
secured these funds much earlier[1], but the relatively large
recent donation has spurred us into action. Essentially what we did was move
the funds to hardware wallets owned by the core development team. This way we
have significantly reduced the risk of the funds being stolen.

This means that we have a new Bitcoin donation address:

* ``bc1qzgw3vsppsa9gu53qyecyu063jfajmjpye3r2h4``

This is where the majority of the funds have been sent and where all new BTC
donations should be sent as well.

We now also have an Ethereum address:

* ``0xC1d472B409c1bdCd8C0E45515D18F08a55fE9fa8``

As a final word, I would also like to ask that if anyone is looking to send us
a large donation to our Bitcoin or Ethereum address, *please* start by sending
us a small amount first and [get in touch](https://nim-lang.org/community.html)
with us about your intentions.
This is just to make sure that we can confirm that the funds
have made it to our wallets safely. If crypto is not your thing, be sure to
check out [our donation page](https://nim-lang.org/donate.html) for other
ways to support the development of Nim.

Thanks again for all your support over the years. Your contributions, both
monetary as well as in the form of pull requests and community building helped
make Nim what it is today.

1 - Just like with backups, it's very important to ensure you have access to
your Bitcoin wallet and that it's safe against attacks. If you are reading this
and remember an old wallet sitting on your flash drive, now might be time to
invest in a hardware wallet and transfer all your funds there.
