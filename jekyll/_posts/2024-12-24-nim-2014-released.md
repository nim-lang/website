The Nim team is happy to announce Nim version 2.0.14, our seventh patch release for Nim 2.0,
for our users who haven't switched yet to [Nim 2.2](https://nim-lang.org/blog/2024/10/02/nim-220-2010.html).

Version 2.0.14 contains [40 commits](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/compare/v2.0.12...v2.0.14), and it brings several improvements to Nim 2.0.12, released two months ago.





## Installing Nim 2.0.14

If you have installed a previous version of Nim using `choosenim`,
getting Nim 2.0.14 is as easy as:

```bash
$ choosenim update self
$ choosenim 2.0.14
```

Make sure that the version of choosenim you have installed is 0.8.5 or higher, otherwise visit [choosenim's repo](https://github.com/nim-lang/choosenim) and see there how to re-install it first, before updating Nim.

Alternatively, you can download Nim 2.0.14 from
[our nightlies builds](https://github.com/nim-lang/nightlies/releases/tag/2024-12-23-version-2-0-bf4de6a394e040d9810cba8c69fb2829ff04dcc6).





## Nim Community Survey 2024

We would like to remind you about [Nim Community Survey](https://nim-lang.org/blog/2024/12/09/community-survey-2024.html).

If you haven't participated yet, now's the time.
It shouldn't take more than 5 minutes, and it helps us to make Nim better.
