# Commercial support

We offer a multitude of support networks including those in both a community
and commercial setting.

Commercial support includes priority bug fixes and feature requests. All
interested parties should email ``support@nim-lang.org``. The bid for
contracting work is a commercial offer provided by:

**Andreas Rumpf**<br/>
St.-Quentin-Ring 47<br/>
67663 Kaiserslautern<br/>
GERMANY<br/>
EU VAT-IN: DE297783450<br/>

## Priority bug fixes

File a bug report and we will address them with the highest priority.
Once fixed, you will be able to access either the current Git build or
at your request a custom build against the latest release with your bug fixed.

## Feature requests

Suggest to us any feature that you might need, we will examine your request
with care and provide a proper answer about its potential for inclusion.

Communication happens via email or for a slightly higher fee via Skype.
The pricing is based on the amount of hours spent on the bugfix / feature
implementation and is open to negotiation.
