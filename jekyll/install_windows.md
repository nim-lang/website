# Installation using ``choosenim``

[``choosenim``](https://github.com/dom96/choosenim#choosenim) is an
installer for the Nim programming language. It allows you
to easily switch between versions of Nim, whether that is the latest stable
release or the latest development version.

To install the latest stable release of Nim using ``choosenim``, 
download the latest Windows version from the
[``releases``](https://github.com/dom96/choosenim/releases) page.

# Notes about binary installation

The installation using the provided zip files should be fairly
straightforward. Simply extract the files into the desired installation
directory, and run ``finish.exe``.

## Configuring the ``PATH`` environment variable

The binaries from the zip file live inside the ``bin`` directory.
It is common for Nim developers to include two directories in their
[``PATH`` environment variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)):

* the aforementioned ``bin`` directory
* ``%USERPROFILE%\.nimble\bin`` (where ``%USERPROFILE%`` is the home directory)

The zip file includes a simple application called ``finish.exe`` that can
attempt to add the first directory into your ``PATH``.
This tool also checks for the presence of a C compiler and can install ``MingW``,
the GNU C compiler collection for Windows.

# Notes about compiler dependencies

The Nim compiler needs a C compiler in order to compile software. You can
use ``finish.exe`` to install MingW.

The following versions of MingW are known to work with the latest version of
Nim.

<!-- TODO: Instructions on what to do with these 7z files? -->

* 32 bit - [mingw32-6.3.0.7z]({{ site.baseurl }}/download/mingw32-6.3.0.7z)
* 64 bit - [mingw64-6.3.0.7z]({{ site.baseurl }}/download/mingw64-6.3.0.7z)

# Other dependencies

There are a number of other dependencies that you may need to install in order
to use Nim. They include:

* PCRE
* OpenSSL

Windows users can download the DLLs for these
[here]({{ site.baseurl }}/download/dlls.zip).
