# General questions

## Why yet another programming language?

Nim is one of the very few _programmable_ statically typed languages, and
combines the speed and memory efficiency of C, an expressive syntax,
memory safety and multiple target languages.

## How stable is Nim?

The compiler and stdlib are actively under development and have a suite of test
cases to ensure ongoing stability. Regular releases are posted every three to
six months that can be used as a base for projects requiring a stable foundation.
Breaking changes are rare but are [documented](https://nim-lang.org/blog/2018/03/01/version-0180-released.html)
in detail and can typically be managed with minimal effort. The compiler also
highlights deprecated features to provide sufficient notice and transition time
through changes.


## How about security and memory safety?

Nim provides memory safety by not performing pointer arithmetic, with
optional [checks](https://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#pragmas-compilation-option-pragmas), traced and untraced references and optional non-nullable types.
It supports Valgrind through the koch tool, and taint analysis.

## How is Nim licensed?

The Nim compiler and the library are MIT licensed.
This means that you can use any license for your own programs developed with
Nim.

## What about JVM/CLR backends?

JVM/CLR support is not in the nearest plans. However, since these VMs support FFI to C
it should be possible to create native Nim bridges, that transparently generate all the
glue code thanks to powerful metaprogramming capabilities of Nim.

## What have been the major influences in the language's design?

The language borrows heavily from (in order of impact): Modula 3, Delphi,
Ada, C++, Python, Lisp, Oberon.

## Why is it named ``proc``?

*Procedure* used to be the common term as opposed to a *function* which is a
mathematical entity that has no side effects. And indeed in Nim ``func``
is syntactic sugar for ``proc {.noSideEffect.}``. Naming it ``def`` would not
make sense because Nim also provides an ``iterator`` and a ``method`` keyword,
whereas ``def`` stands for ``define``.


# Compilation FAQ

## Which option to use for the fastest executable?

For the standard configuration file, ``-d:release`` does the trick.
If supported by your compiler, you can also enable link-time optimization
for an even faster executable: ``--passc:-flto``

## Which option to use for the smallest executable?

For the standard configuration file, ``-d:quick --opt:size`` does the trick.
If supported by your compiler, you can also enable link-time optimization
for an even smaller executable: ``--passc:-flto``

## How do I use a different C compiler than the default one?

Edit the ``config/nim.cfg`` file.
Change the value of the ``cc`` variable to one of the following:

| Abbreviation | C/C++ Compiler                          |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------|
|``vcc``           | Microsoft's Visual C++                      |
|``gcc``           | GNU C compiler                              |
|``llvm_gcc``      | LLVM-GCC compiler                           |
|``icc``           | Intel C compiler                            |
|``clang``         | Clang compiler                              |
|``ucc``           | Generic UNIX C compiler                     |


Other C compilers are not officially supported, but might work too.

If your C compiler is not in the above list, try using the
*generic UNIX C compiler* (``ucc``). If the C compiler needs
different command line arguments try the ``--passc`` and ``--passl`` switches.
