# Meetups

If you're planning on organising a Nim meetup, please let us know, we would
love to include it here and announce it via Twitter and other means.

As of right now, there don't appear to be any active meetups, although the
following groups have been set up:

* [SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil](http://www.meetup.com/pt-BR/nim-br)
* [Berlin, Germany](https://www.meetup.com/The-Nim-Language-Meetup/)

# Issues and RFCs

The issue tracker is hosted on GitHub together with the main repository.
Most projects under the Nim umbrella have their own issue tracker:


* [Nim compiler and standard library issue tracker](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/issues)

* [Nimsuggest issue tracker](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimsuggest/issues)

* [Nimble issue tracker](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble/issues)

* [NimForum issue tracker](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimsuggest/issues)

* [This website's issue tracker](https://github.com/nim-lang/website/issues)

If you have found an issue in the compiler, the standard library or any of
the tools then please create an issue in the relevant repository. If
appropriate include a minimal example reproducing the issue.

If you have a feature request, then consider creating a formal RFC
(Request For Comments). In it you should describe the feature clearly,
including the use cases that you foresee for the feature and anything else
that you think is relevant. RFCs are currently submitted to the
issue tracker.

# Wiki

A good place for general user-submitted articles and content. For instance,
things like random howtos, tutorials, notes, links to interesting content,
and so on. It's also a good place to post material or ideas that come up
during forum or IRC chats, for instance.

It's hosted on GitHub, but also very easy for anyone to edit and share
quickly, without needing to make pull requests.
