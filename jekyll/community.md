# Chat rooms

By far the quickest and easiest way to get involved in our community is
by joining one of our chat rooms.

Our official chat room is the #nim channel on irc.freenode.net. You can
access it in multiple ways:

<i class="fc fa-irc li" aria-hidden="true">#</i>
Use an [IRC client](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat#Clients)
to connect to irc.freenode.net and join the #nim channel. You can also view
the [IRC Logs](https://irclogs.nim-lang.org).

<i class="fab fa-gitter black li" aria-hidden="true"></i>
Join the Gitter chat room, which relays messages both ways between IRC and
Gitter, by clicking [here](https://gitter.im/nim-lang/Nim).

<i class="fab fa-discord black li" aria-hidden="true"></i>
Join the Discord chat room, which relays messages both ways between IRC and
Discord, by clicking [here](https://discord.gg/ezDFDw2).

<i class="fab black li" aria-hidden="true">m</i>
Join the Matrix chat room, which relays messages both ways between IRC and 
Matrix, by clicking [here](https://matrix.to/#/#freenode_#nim:matrix.org).

<i class="fab fa-telegram black li" aria-hidden="true"></i>
Join the Telegram chat room (it doesn't relay any messages) 
by clicking [here](https://t.me/nim_lang).

You can join this chat room to ask a quick question, or engage in a discussion
about features and projects that interest you. For formal feature requests and
issue reporting consult the [Issues and RFCs](#issues-and-rfcs) section.

Be aware that all messages in Gitter, Discord, Matrix and IRC are logged.
You can access the IRC logs of the #nim channel
[here](https://irclogs.nim-lang.org).

The #nim channel is primarily for on-topic discussion. There is also a
semi-official #nim-offtopic channel for off-topic discussion.

If you dislike being logged, there is also a #nim-nologs channel.

# Forum

This is a good place for long questions or to gauge the community's interest
on specific topics such as new features.

# Twitter

For announcements including news about releases, events and projects. Be sure
to follow the official Twitter account and remember to mention
the account when tweeting about Nim!

# Blog

The blog is where we will be posting release announcements and other news first.
If you are an avid RSS user then it should be just for you.

# Reddit

The Nim subreddit contains many user submitted announcements, blog posts,
discussions. It is a good place to share your work with the Nim community and
to get updates about the project so be sure to hit that subscribe button.

# StackOverflow

There is already an active number of Nim developers answering questions on
StackOverflow, you can be one of them. It is also a good place for newcomers to
get help with their project. Be sure to use the ``nim`` tag when asking
questions.

# Meetups

If you're planning on organising a Nim meetup, please let us know, we would
love to include it here and announce it via Twitter and other means.

As of right now, there don't appear to be any active meetups, although the
following groups have been set up:

* [São Paulo, Brazil](http://www.meetup.com/pt-BR/nim-br)
* [Berlin, Germany](https://www.meetup.com/The-Nim-Language-Meetup/)

# Issues and RFCs

The issue tracker is hosted on GitHub together with the main repository.
Most projects under the Nim umbrella have their own issue tracker:


* [Nim compiler and standard library issue tracker](https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/issues)

* [Nimsuggest issue tracker](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimsuggest/issues)

* [Nimble issue tracker](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimble/issues)

* [NimForum issue tracker](https://github.com/nim-lang/nimsuggest/issues)

* [This website's issue tracker](https://github.com/nim-lang/website/issues)

If you have found an issue in the compiler, the standard library or any of
the tools then please create an issue in the relevant repository. If
appropriate include a minimal example reproducing the issue.

If you have a feature request then consider creating a formal RFC
(Request for comments). In it you should describe the feature clearly,
including the use cases that you foresee for the feature and anything else
that you think is relevant. RFCs are currently submitted to the
issue tracker.

# Wiki

A good place for general user-submitted articles and content. For instance,
things like random howtos, tutorials, notes, links to interesting content,
and so on. Also a good place to post material or ideas that come up during
forum or IRC chats, for instance.

It's hosted on github, but also very easy for anyone to edit and share
quickly, without needing to make pull requests.
